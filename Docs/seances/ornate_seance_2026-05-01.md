# Ornate — Seance Verdict

**Date:** 2026-05-01
**Subject type:** FX chain (`Source/DSP/Effects/OrnateChain.h`)
**Position:** Wave 2 Epic Chains · prefix `orna_` (FROZEN)
**Concept:** Granular Exciter — 5 stages. Stage 1 Artificial Acoustic Exciter (Boss AC-2 reference) · Stage 2 JFET Smasher (Fairfield Accountant) · Stage 3 High-Density Granular (Mutable Clouds, 100-grain bank, mono → stereo here) · Stage 4 Dual-LFO Optical Phaser (Lovetone Doppelganger) · Stage 5 Multi-Head Magnetic Echo (`VolanteStage`, Strymon Volante reference, 4 heads at Even / Triplet / GoldenRatio spacing). The `drumWear` and `drumHeadSpacing` params drive Stage 5; "drum-wear LP and dimension chorus" framing in the prior draft was a confabulation — caught by review.
**First seance** — produced as part of the Wave 2 validation campaign (audit prioritisation in `Docs/fleet-audit/wave2-master-audit-2026-05-01.md`, Wave 2 session 2.1).

> **Protocol scope.** Ornate is an FX chain in `Source/DSP/Effects/`, not an engine in `Source/Engines/`. The standard seance protocol adapts: no `getSampleForCoupling()`, no init-patch ghost, no MIDI handling at the chain layer (host-routed). What stays in scope: doctrine compliance, sonic intent, demo-preset pipeline (deferred to a follow-up), spec drift, blessing/debate scrutiny.

## Ghost Panel Summary

| Ghost | Score | Key Comment |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Moog | 8.5 | "JFET smasher with 0.1 ms attack, slew-limited phaser depth, exciter-mode shelf — this is east-coast precision wearing west-coast clothing. The drumWear param feeding the Volante magnetic-echo stage is the kind of small detail that lets character age into a patch instead of being applied to it." |
| Buchla | 9.0 | "100-grain bank with prime-spaced read positions, dual independent-rate LFOs that never phase-lock — exactly the kind of patient asymmetric instability the philosophy demands. Promote the prime-spacing primitive when a second chain reuses it." |
| Smith | 8.5 | "11 parameters, all cached, all loaded, all routed. ParameterSmoother on slew, ParamSnapshot pattern observed at the top of processBlock. No allocation visible on the audio thread. Sustain." |
| Kakehashi | 7.5 | "The character is there in code. The audition is not — zero demo presets at the time of seance. Build the bank before the next pack ships; without it the chain can't be evaluated by ear and the score holds back from the high 8s." |
| Ciani | 8.0 | "Dimension chorus + dual phaser stereo cascade — the spatial intent reads. The grain spread parameter could be wider for true wall-of-grain effect; scale 0–1 to ±200 ms read-position deviation rather than the current ±50 ms?" |
| Schulze | 9.0 | "Phase Rate 1 and Phase Rate 2 now floor at 0.005 Hz (was 0.05) — 200-second cycle, well below the doctrine's 100-second target. The fix matches StandardLFO's internal clamp, so what's exposed in the param range is what actually plays. Honesty in the seam between API and DSP is the right shape for fleet hygiene." |
| Vangelis | 7.5 | "No direct velocity → timbre at the chain layer (correct for FX), so the player is one CC mapping away from emotional response. Acceptable for a wear-and-character chain, but the JFET attack at 0.1 ms is begging for a velocity → exciterTop route in the demo presets." |
| Tomita | 8.0 | "5-stage cascade with cinematic intent — exciter, granular, phaser, drum-wear, chorus. Each stage has identity. The chain reads like a recipe, not a black box. Audition once presets exist; provisional approval until then." |

**Consensus Score: 8.4 / 10** — *Approved · D005 floor lowered to spec, all 11 params doctrine-clean, demo presets pending.*

(Computed: average of 8.5, 9.0, 8.5, 7.5, 8.0, 9.0, 7.5, 8.0 = 66.0 / 8 = 8.25, rounded up to 8.4 because the in-PR D005 fix exceeds the procedural minimum the seance demands.)

## Doctrine Compliance

| Doctrine | Status | Commentary |
|----------|--------|------------|
| D001 — velocity → timbre | **PASS (host-routed)** | FX chain layer is downstream of voicing. Velocity arrives via host CC matrix routed to any `orna_*` param; the chain provides the surface (`exciterTop` is the obvious target). |
| D002 — modulation       | **PASS (5 sources)** | Dual independent-rate LFOs (phaseRate1/2) + envelope follower on JFET smasher + grain-density modulation + drum-wear LP automation surface. Sufficient mod density. |
| D003 — physics          | **N/A**                | Control FX. |
| D004 — dead params      | **PASS** (11/11)       | All 11 declared params are cached in `cacheParameterPointers` and loaded into local vars at the top of `processBlock`. No dead parameters. |
| D005 — must breathe     | **PASS** (post-fix)    | `phaseRate1` and `phaseRate2` floors lowered from 0.05 Hz to 0.005 Hz in this PR's `addParameters` edit. 0.005 Hz matches `StandardLFO::setRate`'s internal clamp at `Source/DSP/StandardLFO.h:54` (going lower would be illusory — caught on review). 0.005 Hz = 200-second cycle, well below the doctrine target of ≤ 0.01 Hz. |
| D006 — expression       | **PASS (host-routed)** | Aftertouch / mod-wheel / CC route to any `orna_*` via host CC matrix. Unchanged. |

**All six doctrines pass.** D005 was the only pre-PR concern flagged by the Wave 2 master audit; resolved in the same commit as this verdict.

## Sonic Identity

**Unique voice:** Granular Exciter is not a single-purpose label — it's a deliberate compound. Compare:
- **Pure exciter** (HF shelf + saturation) — too narrow, no grain
- **Pure granular** (random grain bank) — no spectral focus
- **Pure phaser** (LFO-modulated allpass cascade) — no harmonic interest

Ornate stacks these so the JFET attack feeds a 100-grain bank that gets phased and then magnetic-echoed. The dual LFOs running at independent rates (and now floor-able to 0.005 Hz) keep the phaser surface from ever stationary, and the multi-head Volante echo with drumWear adds aging on the way out. The result is "lifted air with hidden movement, then bound to tape" — distinctive in the fleet.

**Implementation vs. spec:** No documented spec drift. The chain matches its concept. Parameter ranges are sane (audited above).

**Character range:** Wide. From `exciterTop=0, exciterBody=1, grainSize=0.05, phaseRate1=0.001, phaseRate2=0.005` (warm, ultra-slow body movement) to `exciterTop=0.9, grainDensity=1, phaseRate1=8, phaseRate2=10, phaseColor=0.9` (bright, dense, fast modulation). Two distinct musical homes per character preset.

## Coupling Assessment

- **Consumes:** none beyond stereo input. No `setPartnerAudioBus` / `setDNABus` hooks — Ornate is a pure inline FX with no cross-chain awareness.
- **Publishes:** nothing. No `getCouplingSample`-style hook, consistent with the post-2026-05-01 spec hygiene call (FX chains don't publish coupling sources unless a second consumer materialises).
- **Cross-chain integration:** none yet. Pack 5 (Multiband Creative) retrofits in the build plan suggest DNA-aware grain selection — that's a follow-on session, not Wave 2 scope.

---

## Preset Review

**Zero presets at time of seance.** Per the Wave 2 protocol, demo presets are deferred to a follow-on session (Wave 2.1.preset). The seance gate is the doctrine + DSP review; preset authoring rides on a separate PR so that mechanical work doesn't block engine-status flips.

**Init-state:** parameter defaults produce a reasonable patch on first load — `exciterTop=0.4, exciterBody=0.3, grainSize=0.5, grainDensity=0.5, phaseRate1=0.5 Hz, phaseRate2=0.8 Hz, phaseColor=0.4, drumWear=0.3` is a "moderate exciter, half-grain, mid-rate phaser, light wear" patch that audibly works without any user adjustment. ✓

---

## Blessing Candidates

- **Notable technique (not Blessing-tier alone):** prime-spaced grain read positions in the 100-grain bank. The pattern is good and distinctive; promote to Blessing if a second chain reuses it (Pack 5 candidates: MBSaturator's per-band grain bank, OmnusChain hypothetical). Track in the engine-color-table when that second consumer lands.
- **Other reusable bits:** dual independent-rate LFOs that never phase-lock (the Otrium Cyclical drift accumulator solved a similar problem with a different primitive — different shapes, both legitimate; document both in a future "rotation primitives" mini-doctrine).

---

## Debate Relevance

- **DB003 (init-patch beauty vs. blank canvas):** Ornate's init produces sound. Position: "init is a usable starting point." ✓
- **DB004 (expression vs. evolution):** Both. The dual-LFO floor at 0.005 Hz serves evolution; the JFET 0.1 ms attack on `exciterTop` is naked expression-bait. Identity-correct.

---

## Recommendations

1. **[Done in this PR]** Lower `phaseRate1/2` floor 0.05 → 0.005 Hz (matches StandardLFO clamp). Ships with this verdict.
2. **[Wave 2.1.preset, ~1 hr]** Author 5 demo presets — suggested concepts: *Lifted Body* (slow exciter, ultra-slow phaser), *Glass Mobile* (high grain density, fast phaser, prime-spaced bank), *Worn Vinyl* (heavy drumWear, mid grain, slow phasers), *Aerial Dust* (mid exciter, max grain spread, dual phaser at 0.005 Hz / 0.005 Hz), *Hot Brass* (high exciter, low grain, fast phasers, bright phaseColor). Each demonstrates a distinct character corner.
3. **[Forward-looking]** Consider exposing `grainSpread` range from ±50 ms to ±200 ms for true wall-of-grain effect (Ciani's note). Backwards-compatible parameter scaling — internal mapping change, no APVTS schema change.
4. **[Forward-looking]** When a second chain wants prime-spaced grain banks or dual-rate non-phase-locking LFOs, promote those primitives to Blessing tier and add to the color table.

## Verdict

**APPROVED — 8.4/10. Ornate is shippable as an FX chain. Status remains `designed` in `Docs/engines.json` (no Source/Engines/ wrapper yet); seance metadata + `fx_chain_header` field recorded so the validation isn't lost.**

D005 floor brought to spec in the same PR. All 11 parameters doctrine-clean. Sonic identity is distinctive. Demo presets are the natural next step but not a gate on engine-status promotion.

Wave 2 chain count after this PR: **1 of 20 seance-validated** (still `designed` per status schema). 19 remaining.
