## 1. ODDFELIX (OddfeliX)
*Percussive transient synthesis — feliX the neon tetra*

**Accent:** Neon Tetra Blue `#00A6D6` | **Prefix:** `snap_` | **Voices:** 8 (polyphony: 1/2/4/8)
**Creature:** The neon tetra — a flash of iridescent blue darting through sunlit shallows
**Polarity:** Pure feliX — the surface, where energy is highest and sounds are sharpest

### What It Does
feliX himself. A **decay-only percussive engine** — there is no attack, sustain, or release parameter. Every note is instantaneous: the pitch sweep fires the moment a note lands, crashing downward (or upward with `snap_sweepDirection`) from the dart height set by `snap_snap`, and the sound decays away with no sustain. This is deliberate. feliX is a transient; he does not linger.

Three oscillator modes give him range: Sine+Noise for body splashes, FM for metallic surface reflections, Karplus-Strong for the pluck of a fishing line breaking the surface. The HPF→BPF filter cascade (Cytomic SVF) is the water itself — `snap_filterEnvDepth` controls how much the decay envelope opens the filter at the transient peak. The unison detune is the school — one fish becomes two or four, darting in slightly different directions.

feliX is the initiator. He strikes first. His decay envelope is the sharpest envelope in the gallery, and his coupling output drives everything downstream.

### Macros (Recommended)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **DART** | `snap_macroDart` → `snap_snap` + `snap_decay` inverse | The snap of a tail — how sharp the transient is |
| M2 | **SCHOOL** | `snap_macroSchool` → `snap_unison` + `snap_detune` | The school — how many fish, how spread |
| M3 | **SURFACE** | `snap_macroSurface` → `snap_filterCutoff` + `snap_filterReso` | The water surface — how much light filters through |
| M4 | **DEPTH** | `snap_macroDepth` → `snap_filterEnvDepth` + FX sends | How deep the filter opens on each hit |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Default | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `snap_oscMode` | 0/1/2 | 0 | — | 0=Sine+Noise (body splash), 1=FM (metallic reflection), 2=Karplus-Strong (plucked string) |
| `snap_snap` | 0–1 | 0.4 | 0.3–0.6 | Dart intensity — controls pitch sweep height and transient sharpness. The neon flash. |
| `snap_decay` | 0–8s | 0.5 | 0.05–0.5 | How long the ripple lasts. Short for clicks, longer for toms. Skewed (0.3 curve). |
| `snap_sweepDirection` | -1 to +1 | -1.0 | -1.0 | Pitch sweep direction: -1=downward (classic drum), +1=upward (effect snare/pitched tom). |
| `snap_filterCutoff` | 20–20kHz | 2000 | 1–4 kHz | HPF→BPF cascade center. Lower = deeper water; higher = sunlit surface. |
| `snap_filterReso` | 0–1 | 0.3 | 0.2–0.5 | Resonance. Higher = the ring of a droplet hitting still water. |
| `snap_filterEnvDepth` | 0–1 | 0.3 | 0.2–0.6 | How far the decay envelope pushes the filter open at the transient peak. Velocity × depth. |
| `snap_detune` | 0–50 cents | 10 | 5–15 | School spread. Wider = bigger swarm. |
| `snap_unison` | 1/2/4 | 1 | 1–2 | School size — sub-voices per note. 4 = the whole swarm darting at once. |
| `snap_polyphony` | 1/2/4/8 | 4 | 1–4 | How many simultaneous notes. 1 = mono percussion; 4 = melodic use. |
| `snap_level` | 0–1 | 0.8 | 0.7–1.0 | Output level before FX chain. |
| `snap_pitchLock` | on/off | off | — | When on, ignores MIDI note pitch — feliX always fires at the same tuned frequency. Useful for pure percussion. |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Envelope level (ch2) — feliX's transient drives other engines' filters, gates, chokes
- **Receives:** AmpToPitch, LFOToPitch — gentle pitch drift makes the dart less predictable
- **Best as source for:** AmpToFilter (every snap pumps a pad), AmpToChoke (the dart silences)
- **Ecosystem role:** The initiator. feliX gives sharp envelopes that drive other species. He receives slowly — things that make his darting less predictable.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OddOscar:** The primordial coupling. feliX darts, Oscar breathes. Transient over sustain.
- **+ Overdub:** Snap through dub delay — the dart echoing between temperature layers. Classic dub techno.
- **+ Odyssey:** Snap triggers over drifting pad — the neon flash above the open ocean. Ambient percussion.
- **+ Oblique:** Snap transient into prism delay — the dart refracting through shallow water into spectral colors.
- **+ Onset:** Two percussive species schooling — feliX's organic snap alongside Onset's algorithmic precision.

### Starter Recipes
**Tail Snap:** snap_snap=0.8, snap_decay=0.15, snap_oscMode=0, snap_filterCutoff=400, snap_sweepDirection=-1 — feliX's signature dart
**Surface Pluck:** snap_snap=0.5, snap_decay=0.3, snap_oscMode=2 (KS), snap_filterCutoff=3000, snap_filterReso=0.4 — a fishing line breaking the surface
**Metallic Flash:** snap_snap=0.6, snap_decay=0.25, snap_oscMode=1 (FM), snap_filterCutoff=2000, snap_detune=20 — neon scales catching light
**School Stab:** snap_snap=0.4, snap_decay=0.2, snap_unison=4, snap_detune=12, snap_filterCutoff=3000 — the whole swarm darting at once
**Upward Snare:** snap_snap=0.7, snap_decay=0.18, snap_sweepDirection=+1, snap_oscMode=1 (FM), snap_filterCutoff=3500 — the dart that defies gravity
**Pitched Tone:** snap_snap=0.3, snap_decay=1.5, snap_oscMode=2 (KS), snap_pitchLock=off, snap_filterEnvDepth=0.5 — feliX as melodic instrument

## 2. ODDOSCAR (OddOscar)
*Lush pad synthesis with wavetable morph — Oscar the axolotl*

**Accent:** Axolotl Gill Pink `#E8839B` | **Prefix:** `morph_` | **Voices:** 16
**Creature:** The axolotl — pink gills breathing slowly in a coral cave, regenerating, always transforming
**Polarity:** The Reef — Oscar's home territory, where life is densest

### What It Does
Oscar himself. The O in XO_OX. Where feliX darts and vanishes, Oscar remains. Where feliX is a flash, Oscar is a tide. Three detuned oscillators create the chorus width of a coral colony — many identical polyps, slightly out of phase, producing a collective sound richer than any individual. The morph parameter (Sine→Saw→Square→Noise) mirrors the axolotl's metamorphic ability: the same creature, continuously transforming without ever losing its essential nature. Sine is the axolotl at rest. Saw is mid-regeneration, bristling with new tissue. Square is full display. Noise is the axolotl dissolving into the reef itself. The 4-pole Moog ladder filter is the warmth of the reef — resonant, self-oscillating when pushed, capable of singing on its own. The Perlin noise drift is his breathing — never quite the same cycle twice, never mechanical, always organic.

Oscar is the responder. He sustains. He is the tide that holds everything else afloat.

### Macros (Recommended)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **BLOOM** | `morph_morph` sweep | Metamorphosis — how much the axolotl is transforming |
| M2 | **BREATHE** | `morph_drift` + `morph_filterCutoff` | The gill rhythm — how alive the breathing feels |
| M3 | **REGENERATE** | `morph_sub` + `morph_bloom` (attack) | The axolotl's regenerative power — depth + growth speed |
| M4 | **DEPTH** | FX sends + reverb | How deep in the coral cave the sound echoes |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `morph_morph` | 0–3 | 0.5–1.5 | Metamorphosis. Sine(0)→Saw(1)→Square(2)→Noise(3). The axolotl transforming. |
| `morph_filterCutoff` | 20–20kHz | 2–6 kHz | Reef warmth. The Moog ladder opens like a coral polyp. |
| `morph_filterReso` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Self-oscillates above 0.9 — the reef singing to itself. |
| `morph_drift` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.3 | Gill breathing. Perlin noise pitch drift. The organic pulse. |
| `morph_sub` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.5 | Heartbeat. Sub oscillator one octave below — the reef's foundation. |
| `morph_detune` | 0–50 cents | 5–15 | Colony width. Three detuned oscillators spreading like polyps. |
| `morph_bloom` | 0.001–10s | 0.3–2 | Growth speed. How slowly the pad blooms open. |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** 0.3Hz internal LFO (ch2) — the gill rhythm, breathing modulation to the entire gallery
- **Receives:** AmpToFilter (inverted dub pump — feliX's snaps duck Oscar's filter, then it blooms back), EnvToMorph (external envelopes shift morph position — other engines literally change what Oscar sounds like)
- **Best as source for:** LFOToPitch (gentle pitch drift that makes any engine wander organically)
- **Ecosystem role:** The responder. Oscar absorbs energy from other species and transforms it into warmth. His 0.3Hz LFO is a tidal pulse that the whole gallery can breathe to.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OddfeliX:** The primordial coupling. feliX darts, Oscar breathes. Snap transient over morphing pad — the neon tetra darting through coral.
- **+ Oblong:** Two reef-dwellers layered. Oscar's liquid morph + Bob's curious texture = the living coral colony.
- **+ Optic:** Oscar feeds Optic for spectral analysis — bioluminescent plankton reacting to the reef's slow breathing.
- **+ Odyssey:** Two drift systems overlapping. Oscar's Perlin breathing + Drift's Voyager walk = interference patterns like overlapping ripples.
- **+ Overbite:** Oscar's warmth feeding the anglerfish's lure. EnvToMorph from Overbite shifts Oscar's metamorphosis — the predator reshaping its prey.

### Starter Recipes
**Coral Breath:** morph=0.3, filterCutoff=3000, reso=0.3, drift=0.2, sub=0.4 — the axolotl at rest in warm water
**Metamorphosis:** morph automated via M1, filterCutoff=1500, reso=0.5, drift=0.4 — the creature mid-transformation
**Reef Dissolve:** morph=2.5, filterCutoff=800, reso=0.6, drift=0.1 — Oscar becoming indistinguishable from the coral
**Deep Colony:** morph=0.8, detune=20, sub=0.6, filterCutoff=2000, bloom=1.5 — the full polyp chorus, wide and warm
**Singing Ladder:** morph=0.1, filterCutoff=1200, reso=0.85, drift=0.15 — the filter self-oscillating, the reef singing

## 3. OVERDUB (Overdub)
*Dub synthesis with tape delay and spring reverb — the thermocline*

**Accent:** Olive `#6B7B3A` | **Prefix:** `dub_` | **Voices:** 8
**Creature:** The thermocline — the invisible boundary where warm surface water meets cold deep water
**Polarity:** Dead center — 50/50 feliX/Oscar, the meeting point between worlds

### What It Does
The thermocline. The invisible boundary where warm surface water meets cold deep water, typically between 200 and 1000 meters. Sound behaves strangely here — it bends, refracts, bounces between density layers, degrades over distance. A whale call launched at the thermocline can travel thousands of miles, losing high frequencies with each reflection, gaining a ghostly character that marine biologists call "shadow zones." That is exactly what XOverdub does to every note.

The tape delay is sound traveling through water. The wow (0.3Hz sine) pulls timing like a slow swell. The flutter (45Hz noise) adds the micro-instability of turbulence. The bandpass feedback narrowing is the ocean filtering the signal with each bounce — eating highs and lows until only the mid-range ghost remains. The spring reverb is a sunken ship's hull — six allpass stages ringing like steel plates struck underwater. The drive is pressure building at depth.

Dub music was always underwater music. Lee "Scratch" Perry and King Tubby were building thermoclines in their studios. XOverdub makes the metaphor literal. He is the water that other species swim through.

### Macros (Recommended)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **ECHO** | `dub_delayFeedback` + `dub_delayWear` | The distance — how far the sound travels through water |
| M2 | **CURRENT** | `dub_delayWow` + `dub_drift` | The swell — how much the current pulls the timing |
| M3 | **PRESSURE** | `dub_driveAmount` + `dub_filterCutoff` | The depth — how much pressure distorts the signal |
| M4 | **HULL** | `dub_reverbSize` + `dub_reverbMix` | The ship — how much the hull resonates around the echo |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `dub_oscWave` | Sine/Tri/Saw/Sq | Sine or Saw | The source signal — what enters the water |
| `dub_filterCutoff` | 20–20kHz | 400–2000 | The thermocline itself — where warm meets cold. 3 modes (LP/HP/BP). |
| `dub_delayTime` | 0.05–2s | 0.3–0.5 | Distance between reflections. Try 3/8 note for classic dub spacing. |
| `dub_delayFeedback` | 0–1.2 | 0.4–0.7 | How many times the sound bounces. >1.0 = runaway — the echo never stops. |
| `dub_delayWear` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.4 | Tape degradation. Each bounce loses more detail, like sound traveling miles through water. |
| `dub_delayWow` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.2 | The swell. Subtle = warmth, heavy = seasick pitch drift on every echo. |
| `dub_driveAmount` | 1–10 | 1.5–3 | Depth pressure. Subtle warmth to full saturation — the sound compressed by the ocean. |
| `dub_reverbMix` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.3 | Hull resonance. The spring reverb. A little = steel hull. A lot = inside the wreck. |
| `dub_sendLevel` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | How much signal enters the FX chain. The send into the deep. |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Pitch envelope (ch2) — short, punchy envelopes from the oscillator, before the delay touches them
- **Receives:** AmpToFilter (inverted pump — the classic dub sidechain), AmpToPitch, LFOToPitch
- **Best as source for:** AudioToFM (tape-degraded audio as FM source — the ghost of a note modulating something alive)
- **Ecosystem role:** The great receiver. Every engine sounds different through Overdub's echo chamber. He takes any signal and gives it history — repetition, degradation, space. He is the water that other species swim through.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OddfeliX:** feliX's dart echoing through the thermocline — the snap becomes a rhythm. Instant dub techno.
- **+ OddOscar:** Oscar's pads gaining history — each echo slightly different because the drift has moved. Infinite, evolving sustain.
- **+ Oblique:** Dub sub-bass foundation + Oblique's prismatic refraction = the full water column, bottom to shimmer.
- **+ Optic:** Optic's AutoPulse drives Dub's filter for rhythmic pumping — bioluminescent flashes triggering echo gates.
- **+ Overbite:** The anglerfish's bass through the thermocline. The deepest dub imaginable — predator biology echoing through temperature gradients.
- **+ Onset:** Drum hits echoing through water — every splash creating a trail of ghostly repetitions.

### Starter Recipes
**Shadow Zone:** oscWave=Sine, filterCutoff=600, sub=0.7, delayMix=0.1, voiceMode=Mono — the bass note trapped between temperature layers
**Thermocline Echo:** oscWave=Saw, delayTime=0.375, feedback=0.6, wear=0.4, wow=0.15, reverb=0.25 — sound bouncing between warm and cold
**Siren at Depth:** oscWave=Saw, glide=0.5, filterCutoff=2000, reso=0.6, voiceMode=Legato — a whale call sliding through the deep
**Sunken Hull:** oscWave=Tri, reverb=0.5, reverbSize=0.8, drive=2.0, delayFeedback=0.3 — the resonance of a ship on the ocean floor
**Mile-Deep Ghost:** delayFeedback=0.85, wear=0.7, wow=0.2, filterCutoff=800 — a note that has traveled for miles and forgotten what it was

## 4. ODYSSEY (Odyssey)
*Evolving pad synthesis with Voyager drift and Climax bloom — the open ocean*

**Accent:** Violet `#7B2D8B` | **Prefix:** `odyssey_` | **Voices:** 8
**Creature:** The open ocean — the pelagic zone, where currents carry you from the familiar into the unknown
**Polarity:** Open Water — between surface and deep, Oscar-leaning but with feliX's restless movement

### What It Does
The open ocean. No reef, no shore, no floor — just the vast middle water where the only landmarks are shifting gradients of light, temperature, and pressure. The Voyager Drift is the current — a smooth random walk on pitch and filter that ensures you never hear the same note the same way twice. Not chaos. The organized unpredictability of a living ocean. Per-voice seeded RNG means each voice drifts independently — a held chord becomes a living organism.

Three oscillator modes are three species encountered on the voyage. Classic PolyBLEP is the familiar shore — clean waveforms you recognize. Supersaw is the school of fish — seven detuned voices swimming in formation, creating a wall of width. FM is the bioluminescent flash — metallic, alien, harmonically complex. Dual oscillators (A and B) mean you can layer the familiar with the alien in a single voice. The Haze Saturation is warmth rising from below. The Formant Filter is the voice of the ocean — vowel shapes (ah, eh, ee, oh, oo) morphing as if the water is trying to speak. The Prism Shimmer is sunlight refracting through the surface far above.

Odyssey is the traveler. She tells a story. Alone, she asks a question.

### Macros (Recommended)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **JOURNEY** | `odyssey_oscA_mode` blend + character stages | The voyage — how far from shore you've traveled |
| M2 | **DRIFT** | `odyssey_driftDepth` + `odyssey_driftRate` | The current — how strong and fast the ocean pulls |
| M3 | **SHIMMER** | `odyssey_hazeAmount` + `odyssey_shimmerAmount` | Depth of light — how much warmth and refraction |
| M4 | **VOICE** | `odyssey_formantMorph` + `odyssey_formantMix` | The ocean speaking — which vowel the water shapes |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `odyssey_driftDepth` | 0–1 | 0.15–0.35 | Current strength. How far each note wanders from home. The "alive" factor. |
| `odyssey_driftRate` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Current speed. How quickly new targets appear in the random walk. |
| `odyssey_oscA_mode` | 0/1/2 | — | 0=Classic (shore), 1=Supersaw (the school), 2=FM (the deep flash) |
| `odyssey_hazeAmount` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Thermocline warmth. Pre-filter tanh saturation — warmth rising from below. |
| `odyssey_formantMorph` | 0–4 | 0.5–2.5 | The ocean's vowel. Sweeps ah→eh→ee→oh→oo. Slow automation = the water speaking. |
| `odyssey_shimmerAmount` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.4 | Sunlight refraction. Full-wave rectification adding upper partials like light through water. |
| `odyssey_filterCutoff` | 20–20kHz | 1.5–5 kHz | Depth. Lower = deeper water, less light. The LP filter is the water column itself. |
| `odyssey_attack` | 0.001–2s | 0.05–0.3 | How slowly the voyage begins. Long attacks for cinematic swells. |
| `odyssey_oscA_detune` | 0–100 | 8–15 | School spread (Supersaw mode). Wider = bigger school. |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Peak envelope (ch2) — always shifting because of the Voyager Drift, making receiving engines feel alive
- **Receives:** AmpToFilter (feliX or Onset create rhythmic filter movement — surface percussion heard as filter pumps in the deep), LFOToPitch, AmpToPitch, EnvToMorph (sweeps formant vowel — other engines change the words the ocean is speaking)
- **Best as source for:** AudioToFM (drifting output as FM source — the voyage as modulation)
- **Ecosystem role:** The traveler. She gives evolving envelopes that make other engines feel alive. When coupled, she tells a story. Alone, she asks a question.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OddfeliX:** The neon flash above the open ocean. Snap transients over drifting pad — ambient percussion from another world.
- **+ Overdub:** Drifting pads gaining history — each echo slightly different because the drift has moved between repetitions. Time made audible.
- **+ OddOscar:** Two drift systems creating interference patterns — Oscar's Perlin breathing + Odyssey's Voyager walk = overlapping ripples in open water.
- **+ Optic:** Spectral analysis of the voyage — bioluminescent plankton reacting to the ocean's harmonic content.
- **+ Opal:** Two evolving engines stacked — granular particles scattered across the open ocean. Deep ambient clouds.
- **+ Overbite:** The journey descending to predator depth. Odyssey's shimmer feeding the anglerfish's lure.

### Starter Recipes
**Open Water:** attack=0.3, sustain=0.8, release=2.0, drift=0.25, detune=12, filterCutoff=4000 — the moment the shore disappears behind you
**Pelagic Dark:** filterCutoff=800, reso=0.4, drift=0.3, detune=20, hazeAmount=0.4 — deep water where only blue light reaches
**Shore Keys:** attack=0.005, decay=0.3, sustain=0.5, filterCutoff=6000, drift=0.1 — the familiar coast, gentle current
**Vowel Drift:** formantMorph automated, formantMix=0.6, drift=0.2, shimmer=0.3 — the ocean trying to speak
**Bioluminescent:** oscA_mode=2 (FM), fmDepth=0.4, shimmer=0.5, drift=0.3, filterCutoff=3000 — alien flash in the deep water

## 5. OBLONG (Oblong)
*Warm character synthesis — soft coral that breathes*

**Accent:** Amber `#E9A84A` | **Prefix:** `bob_` | **Voices:** 8
**Creature:** Living coral — soft tissue, symbiotic algae, the architecture of the reef itself
**Polarity:** The Reef — 75% Oscar / 25% feliX, warm and patient with a curious, darting playfulness

### What It Does
Living coral. Not the skeletal calcium carbonate tourists mistake for rock — the soft tissue itself, the polyps, the mucus layer, the symbiotic algae that give coral its color. Touch a living coral and it feels warm, slightly yielding, faintly sticky. That is the XOblongBob sound. The Oblong Sine waveform — a sine with a gentle second harmonic folded in — is the polyp: simple in structure, complex in texture. The Velvet Saw and Cushion Pulse are swaying arms that filter-feed from the current. Every waveform has been softened, rounded, given a tactile quality that feels closer to organic tissue than electronic oscillation.

The BobSnoutFilter is the coral's relationship with passing water — four character modes (Snout LP, Snout BP, Snout Form, Snout Soft) each represent a different interaction with current. The BobCuriosityLFO system — five behavior modes (Sniff, Wander, Investigate, Twitch, Nap) — is the coral's nervous system, responding with the slow, exploratory movements of an organism that has no brain but somehow still seems curious. Bob does not compute modulation. Bob sniffs, wanders, investigates, twitches, and naps.

He is Oscar's architecture. The reef that every other species depends on.

### Macros (Recommended)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **SNOUT** | `bob_fltCutoff` + `bob_fltMode` character | The coral mouth — how the polyps filter the current |
| M2 | **CURIOSITY** | `bob_curiosity` + LFO behavior | The nervous system — how the coral responds to stimulation |
| M3 | **TEXTURE** | `bob_textureType` + `bob_textureLevel` | The tissue — what type of organic surface the coral grows |
| M4 | **REEF** | `bob_dustTape` + `bob_drift` | The age — how weathered and analog the coral structure feels |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `bob_fltCutoff` | 20–20kHz | 1–4 kHz | The coral mouth. How open the polyp is to the current. |
| `bob_fltReso` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Resonance — the mouth singing. Self-oscillates at high values. |
| `bob_curiosity` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | The nervous system. Higher = the coral is more alert, more exploratory, weirder. |
| `bob_drift` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.2 | Per-oscillator analog instability. The organic sway of coral in current. |
| `bob_oscAWave` | 0–3 | — | 0=Oblong Sine (polyp), 1=Soft Triangle, 2=Velvet Saw (arms), 3=Cushion Pulse |
| `bob_textureType` | 0–3 | — | 0=Dust, 1=Blanket, 2=Static, 3=Breath — the surface texture of the coral |
| `bob_dustTape` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.3 | Tape saturation. The age and weathering of the reef structure. |
| `bob_fltMode` | 0–3 | — | 0=Snout LP (warm), 1=Snout BP (nasal), 2=Snout Form (vowel), 3=Snout Soft (gentle) |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Stereo audio (ch0/1), envelope level (ch2)
- **Receives:** AmpToFilter (drum hits bloom the coral open — Onset drives the Snout), AmpToPitch, LFOToPitch
- **Best as source for:** Amplitude coupling that softens aggressive engines — passing through coral structure warms everything
- **Ecosystem role:** The reef that other species shelter in. His output softens whatever it touches. The contrast between his warmth and feliX-leaning engines' sharpness creates the most musical pairings in the gallery.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OddfeliX:** Neon tetra darting through coral — feliX's snap transients against Bob's warm, yielding texture. The signature pairing.
- **+ Overdub:** Bob's curious harmonics through Dub's tape delay — vintage keys heard through a sunken ship's hull.
- **+ Obese:** The reef sheltering the whale. Bob provides character and warmth, Fat provides mass. Layered bass at its best.
- **+ Oblique:** Bob's curious harmonics through Oblique's prismatic refraction — the light scattering through shallow coral water. Kaleidoscopic.
- **+ Onset:** Drum hits blooming the coral open — AmpToFilter from Onset drives Bob's Snout, and every snare makes the reef breathe.
- **+ Organon:** Two biological systems communicating — coral metabolism meeting deep-sea chemistry. Slow, strange, alive.

### Starter Recipes
**Polyp Touch:** oscA=Oblong Sine, fltCutoff=3000, curiosity=0.3, drift=0.15 — the warm, yielding surface of living coral
**Funky Stab:** attack=0.002, decay=0.15, sustain=0.4, fltCutoff=3000, curiosity=0.3 — a coral arm snapping at passing plankton
**Reef Bass:** attack=0.001, decay=0.3, sustain=0.0, fltCutoff=1500, reso=0.5, dustTape=0.2 — the foundation, warm and deep
**Curious Pad:** curiosity=0.5, fltMode=2 (Snout Form), drift=0.2, texture=Breath — the coral responding to something it doesn't understand
**Amber Hour:** oscA=Velvet Saw, fltCutoff=4000, curiosity=0.15, drift=0.15, dustTape=0.3 — the reef at golden hour, glowing

## 6. OBESE (Obese)
*Massive width synthesis — the whale*

**Accent:** Hot Pink `#FF1493` | **Prefix:** `fat_` | **Voices:** 6
**Creature:** The whale — the largest creature in the water column, 188 decibels across the ocean basin
**Polarity:** Open Water — the whale belongs to no reef, no shore, no single depth

### What It Does
The whale. When a blue whale vocalizes at 188 decibels, the sound travels through the entire ocean basin. Every creature for a thousand miles hears it — not as a distant echo but as a pressure wave that moves through their body. Thirteen oscillators — one sub, four groups of three, each tuned at root, +12, and -12 semitones with per-oscillator analog drift. The sound does not sit in a mix. It displaces everything else.

The Mojo system is the whale's biology. Each oscillator receives independent random-walk pitch drift of up to three cents. At Mojo zero, XObese is a digital supersaw — precise, clinical, impressive but lifeless. At Mojo one, it breathes. The drift is subtle enough that the ear hears warmth rather than detuning, the same way whale song sounds "warm" even though it is mathematically complex. Four ZDF Ladder Filters — one per oscillator group, each with proper tan() pre-warp, inter-stage soft-clip, and Nyquist-aware resonance scaling — are the whale's vocal tract, shaping raw oscillator mass into something musical rather than merely overwhelming.

The arpeggiator is the whale's rhythm — cyclical patterns of diving and surfacing. The hot pink accent is the belly of a right whale surfacing — unexpected beauty on something that massive.

### Macros (Recommended)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **MASS** | `fat_unisonSpread` + morph position | The whale's size — how much of the frequency spectrum it fills |
| M2 | **SONG** | `fat_filterCutoff` + `fat_filterReso` | The vocal tract — how the whale shapes its call |
| M3 | **MOJO** | `fat_mojo` (analog drift) | The biology — how alive the thirteen oscillators breathe |
| M4 | **SURFACE** | `fat_satDrive` + bitcrush | The breach — the distortion of the whale breaking the surface |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `fat_satDrive` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | The breach. Asymmetric waveshaping — the distortion of 188 dB through water. |
| `fat_filterCutoff` | 20–20kHz | 800–4000 | The vocal tract. Four ZDF ladders shaping thirteen oscillators into song. |
| `fat_filterReso` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Vocal resonance. Smooth self-oscillation — the whale's harmonic overtones. |
| `fat_unisonSpread` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | School size. How far apart the thirteen oscillators drift. Width measured in miles. |
| `fat_mojo` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.4 | The biology. Per-oscillator random walk drift. 0=digital, 1=alive. |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Stereo audio (ch0/1), envelope level (ch2) — raw, massive amplitude
- **Receives:** AmpToFilter, AmpToPitch, LFOToPitch — pitch and filter modulation that shapes the whale into something that breathes
- **Best as source for:** AudioToRing (thirteen oscillators ring-modding = seismic), AmpToFilter (every note opens receiving engines wide)
- **Ecosystem role:** The whale gives amplitude. Without external modulation, he is a wall. With coupling, he is an ocean.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OddfeliX:** The whale surfacing where the neon tetra swims. Fat body + feliX's snap = punchy bass with click. Scale difference as musicality.
- **+ Oblique:** Fat bass foundation + Oblique's prismatic bouncing tops — the full depth of the ocean from whale song to surface refraction.
- **+ Optic:** Optic's AutoPulse strobing Fat's filter — bioluminescent flashes pumping the whale's vocal tract. Club-ready.
- **+ Overdub:** The whale song echoing through the thermocline. Thirteen oscillators degrading beautifully through tape delay over distance.
- **+ Overbite:** The whale meeting the anglerfish. Mass meets predation. The widest bass feeding the deepest bite.
- **+ Oblong:** The whale sheltering in the reef. Fat provides mass, Bob provides character. Together: warm, immense, alive.

## 7. OVERBITE (Overbite)
*Bass-forward character synth — the anglerfish*

**Accent:** Fang White `#F0EDE8` | **Prefix:** `poss_` | **Voices:** 16
**Creature:** The anglerfish — a soft bioluminescent lure hiding the widest jaw in the deep
**Polarity:** The Deep — 80% Oscar / 20% feliX, patient and ambush-hunting, but the Bite macro reveals feral energy

### What It Does
The anglerfish. Two thousand meters below the surface, in water so dark that color has no meaning, a point of light appears. Soft. Warm. Pulsing gently. It looks like safety. It is the most dangerous thing in the ocean. XOverbite is built on this duality: two oscillator banks where OscA ("Belly" — four warm waveforms: Sine, Triangle, Saw, Cushion Pulse) is the lure, and OscB ("Bite" — five aggressive waveforms: Hard Sync, FM, Ring Mod, Noise, Grit) is the jaw.

Five character stages form the anatomy of a predator. **Fur** is the anglerfish's textured skin — pre-filter tanh saturation adding plush even harmonics. The **CytomicSVF filter** is the mouth — four modes (LP, BP, HP, Notch) with key tracking and envelope-driven movement. **Chew** is the jaw muscle — post-filter soft-knee compression adding sustain and body. **Gnash** is the teeth — asymmetric waveshaping where the positive half clips harder, creating odd harmonics that cut like fangs. **Trash** is the aftermath — three dirt modes (Rust bitcrush, Splatter wavefold, Crushed hard-clip) representing what happens after the bite.

The Weight Engine reinforces the sub-harmonic foundation — five shapes, three octaves below. The signal path is an anatomy lesson in predation.

### Macros (Built)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **BELLY** | Closes filter, raises sub + fur + weight | The lure — warm, round, glowing, irresistible |
| M2 | **BITE** | Opens OscB mix, drives gnash + resonance | The jaw — the instant it snaps shut |
| M3 | **SCURRY** | Multiplies LFO rates, compresses envelopes | The nervous system — the twitching energy underneath the patience |
| M4 | **TRASH** | Raises trash amount + resonance | The aftermath — what remains after the anglerfish feeds |
| M5 | **PLAY DEAD** | Extends release, ducks level, closes filter | Going dark — retracting the lure, becoming invisible |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `poss_osc_mix` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Belly↔Bite balance. The lure vs the jaw. 0 = pure lure, 1 = pure fangs. |
| `poss_filter_cutoff` | 20–20kHz | 800–3000 | The mouth. How wide the jaw opens. |
| `poss_filter_reso` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | How much the mouth resonates — higher = a growl building in the throat. |
| `poss_fur_amount` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Skin texture. Plush even harmonics before the filter. The lure's glow. |
| `poss_gnash_amount` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.4 | Teeth. Asymmetric distortion — the odd harmonics that cut through everything. |
| `poss_trash_amount` | 0–1 | 0–0.3 | Destruction. Bitcrush/wavefold/hard-clip — what the anglerfish leaves behind. |
| `poss_weight_level` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Sub-harmonic reinforcement. The physical mass of the predator. |
| `poss_osc_b_wave` | 0–4 | — | 0=HardSync, 1=FM, 2=RingMod, 3=Noise, 4=Grit — which type of bite |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Stereo audio (ch0/1), envelope level (ch2) — bass-heavy output with predator character
- **Receives:** AmpToFilter (drum hits pump the jaw open — Onset drives the Bite macro), AudioToFM (external audio FM-modulates OscB — feeding the bite with other species' spectral content)
- **Best as source for:** AudioToFM (Gnash-shaped audio as FM source — the predator's harmonic signature modulating other engines)
- **Ecosystem role:** The predator. He receives energy and transforms it into ambush. He feeds from above and lurks below.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ Onset:** Drum hits driving the Bite macro — every snare triggers the jaw reflex. The snare is the prey.
- **+ Obese:** The whale meeting the anglerfish. Fat's mass driving Overbite's filter = the widest, deepest bass in the ocean.
- **+ Overdub:** Anglerfish bass through the thermocline's tape delay — the deepest dub imaginable. Predator biology echoing through temperature gradients.
- **+ OddfeliX:** The neon tetra entering anglerfish territory — feliX's bright transients feeding Overbite's FM input. Prey becoming predator texture.
- **+ Organon:** Anglerfish biology meeting alien chemistry — Fur saturation into metabolic processing. Deep, strange, and alive.
- **+ Oblong:** The predator sheltered by the reef. Overbite's aggression softened by Bob's warmth — bass that bites but doesn't hurt.

### Starter Recipes
**The Lure:** belly=1.0, bite=0.0, fur=0.4, filterCutoff=800, weight=0.5 — the glowing bioluminescent orb, warm and inviting
**The Jaw:** belly=0.0, bite=1.0, gnash=0.5, filterCutoff=2000, oscB=HardSync — the moment the mouth opens. All fangs.
**Ambush Bass:** belly=0.6, bite=0.3, fur=0.3, gnash=0.2, filterCutoff=1200 — between lure and jaw, where the real danger lives
**Deep Prowl:** belly=0.4, scurry=0.5, filterCutoff=1000, weight=0.6, voiceMode=Mono — the anglerfish circling, nervous energy under patience
**Play Dead:** playDead=1.0, release=3.0, filterCutoff=400 — the lure retracts, the predator becomes invisible, waiting

## 8. ONSET (Onset)
*Algorithmic drum synthesis with Cross-Voice Coupling — surface splashes*

**Accent:** Electric Blue `#0066FF` | **Prefix:** `perc_` | **Voices:** 8 (fixed kit)
**Creature:** Surface splashes — fish leaping, tails slapping, rain striking the ocean in a downpour
**Polarity:** Pure feliX — the surface, where energy is highest and every sound is an event, not a process

### What It Does
Surface splashes. Eight voices, each a different kind of impact event — the physics of water breaking. The kick is a body entering water from height — the BridgedT oscillator's pitch envelope sweeps down like displacement pressure. The snare is a wave breaking on rock — the NoiseBurst circuit's dual-sine body with high-passed noise burst. The hats are rain — the MetallicOsc's six inharmonic square waves through bandpass filtering, the bright patter of droplets on the ocean surface.

The dual-layer architecture mirrors impact physics: **Layer X** (circuit models — BridgedT, NoiseBurst, MetallicOsc) is the body of the collision, the analog truth of a 808 kick or metallic hat. **Layer O** (algorithmic synthesis — FM, Modal Resonator, Karplus-Strong, Phase Distortion) is the character, the alien synthesis that no drum machine has ever produced. The blend knob per voice is the key: at zero, you get an 808 kick; at one, you get an FM percussion hit tuned to the same frequency; in between, something that has never existed in hardware.

**Cross-Voice Coupling (XVC)** is schooling behavior made audible. Eight voices reacting to each other — kick pumps the snare's filter, hat chokes the open hat, clap triggers the tom. Not a sequencer — an ecosystem of rhythmic organisms reacting in real time. The same way a flash of silver in a school triggers a chain reaction.

### Macros (Built)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **MACHINE** | Layer X↔O blend bias across all voices | The species — how analog (fish) vs algorithmic (electric) the kit sounds |

## 12. ORGANON (Organon)
*Biochemical metabolism synth — Variational Free Energy drives Port-Hamiltonian modal arrays*

**Accent:** Bioluminescent Cyan `#00CED1` | **Prefix:** `organon_` | **Voices:** 4

### What It Does
ORGANON is a deep-sea chemotroph: it eats audio signals and converts their information content into living harmonic structures. Each of the 4 voices is an independent organism with its own metabolic state machine based on the Variational Free Energy / Active Inference framework (Karl Friston, 2010). The organism ingests audio — from a coupling partner or its own internal noise substrate — filters it through an enzyme selectivity bandpass, analyzes its entropy, then uses that signal to drive a Port-Hamiltonian modal array (descended from Julius O. Smith III's modal synthesis). Free energy accumulates on note-on and dissipates on release; when the organism starves it dims, when fed rich signal it blooms. Blessed (B011): unanimous seance praise, described as publishable research.

No two performances sound identical — metabolic state accumulates from coupling history.

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `organon_metabolicRate` | 0.1–10 Hz | 0.5–3.0 | Speed of energy turnover. 0.1 Hz = glacial deep-sea, 10 Hz = frantic surface feeding. Aftertouch accelerates this. |
| `organon_enzymeSelect` | 20–20000 Hz | 200–4000 | Bandpass center for ingestion. Narrow = specialist feeder, high = generalist. |
| `organon_catalystDrive` | 0–2 | 0.4–1.2 | How aggressively metabolic energy excites the modal array. 0 = silent, 2 = potentially self-exciting. |
| `organon_dampingCoeff` | 0.01–0.99 | 0.15–0.45 | Damping in the modal ODE. Low = long crystalline tails, high = muted percussive response. |
| `organon_signalFlux` | 0–1 | 0.4–0.8 | Gain of the ingestion input — coupling audio or internal noise. 0 = starved, 1 = fully fed. |
| `organon_phasonShift` | 0–1 | 0–0.6 | Temporal offset between the 4 voices' metabolic cycles. 0 = unison pulse, 1 = fully polyrhythmic (voices fully out of phase). Named after quasicrystal phason modes. |
| `organon_isotopeBalance` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | Spectral weighting of modal partials. 0 = subharmonic (dark), 0.5 = natural harmonic series, 1 = upper partials (metallic, alien). |
| `organon_lockIn` | 0–1 | 0–0.5 | Sync metabolic rate to DAW tempo. 0 = free-running organic drift, 1 = quantized to beat subdivisions. |
| `organon_membrane` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.4 | Membrane porosity — reverb send level. High porosity leaks energy into shared reverb. VFE surprise modulates this automatically: stressed organisms sweat more. |
| `organon_noiseColor` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | Spectral tilt of internal noise substrate (when no coupling partner feeds the organism). 0 = dark rumble, 0.5 = white, 1 = bright hiss. Coupling input bypasses this. |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Metabolic modal output (ch0/1) — usable as AudioToFM or AudioToWavetable source for partner engines
- **Receives:** AudioToFM, AudioToWavetable (audio feeds the ingestion stage — organism eats it), RhythmToBlend, EnvToDecay, AmpToFilter, EnvToMorph, LFOToPitch, PitchToPitch
- **Best as target for:** Any audio-output engine (Ouroboros, Obese, Onset) — ORGANON literally digests their output into harmonic structure
- **Mod wheel:** Adds up to +3 Hz to metabolic rate | **Aftertouch:** Boosts metabolic rate and free energy — plays the organism harder

### Variational Free Energy (B011 — Seance Blessed)
The VFE state machine tracks three internal readouts per voice that shape sound automatically:
- **freeEnergy:** Envelopes output amplitude — builds on note-on, dissipates on release
- **surprise:** Shifts fundamental pitch and widens stereo spread when organism is stressed; also modulates `organon_membrane` reverb send
- **adaptationGain:** Scales catalyst drive — well-adapted organisms amplify their own excitation

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ Ouroboros:** Chaos attractor output feeds ORGANON's ingestion — organism metabolizes chaos into harmonic structure
- **+ Onset:** Drum transients feed the enzyme bandpass — percussive bursts bloom into resonant modal clouds
- **+ Opal:** ORGANON's modal output drives Opal grain scatter — living harmonic organism seeds a granular cloud
- **+ Optic:** ORGANON's evolving modal output drives Optic's visual modulator in real-time

## 13. OUROBOROS (Ouroboros)
*Chaotic ODE synthesis — the strange attractor*

### What It Does
RK4-integrated chaotic ordinary differential equations at 4× oversampling. Four selectable attractor topologies (Lorenz, Rossler, Chua, Aizawa) with Phase-Locked Chaos ("The Leash") for tonal control. 3D attractor trajectory projected to stereo via theta/phi angles. Accepts external ODE perturbation (`ouro_injection`) from coupled engines — meaning drum hits can literally push the chaos. This is not delay-line or feedback synthesis. It is the sound of a differential equation solving itself in real time.

### Key Parameters

## 16. ORACLE (Oracle)
*Stochastic GENDY + Maqam microtonal synthesis (B010 Blessed)*

**Accent:** Prophecy Indigo `#4B0082` | **Prefix:** `oracle_` | **Voices:** 8

### What It Does
Iannis Xenakis' GENDY algorithm: stochastic breakpoint waveforms where 8–32 breakpoints per waveform cycle undergo random walks drawn from a morphable Cauchy/Logistic distribution blend. Mirror barriers reflect overshooting values. Cubic Hermite (Catmull-Rom) interpolation renders smooth per-sample output between breakpoints. Plus 9-option Maqam tuning system (12-TET + 8 maqamat with quarter-tone microtonal steps) blended via the GRAVITY parameter. Two ADSR envelopes: amplitude and stochastic activity. Sounds like prophecy — alien, unpredictable, ancient.

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `oracle_breakpoints` | 8–32 | 12–20 | Breakpoints per cycle. More = more complex waveform. |
| `oracle_timeStep` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.4 | How far breakpoints walk in time per cycle. Higher = more rhythmic instability. |
| `oracle_ampStep` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | How far breakpoints walk in amplitude per cycle. Higher = wilder timbral chaos. |

| `oracle_maqam` | 12-TET/Rast/Bayati/Saba/Hijaz/Sikah/Nahawand/Kurd/Ajam | 12-TET | Tuning system. 12-TET = standard. Any other = Maqam quarter-tone intonation. |
| `oracle_gravity` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.8 | Blend between 12-TET (0.0) and selected Maqam tuning (1.0). |
| `oracle_drift` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Long-term waveform drift. Slowly reshapes the stochastic character over time. |

## 17. OBSCURA (Obscura)
*Scanned synthesis — 128-mass spring chain physics*

**Accent:** Daguerreotype Silver `#8A9BA8` | **Prefix:** `obscura_` | **Voices:** 8

### What It Does
Implements the scanned synthesis technique pioneered by Bill Verplank and Max Mathews at CCRMA (Stanford, late 1990s). A 128-mass spring chain is simulated at ~4 kHz using Verlet integration. At note-on, a Gaussian impulse excites the chain at `obscura_excitePos` with width `obscura_exciteWidth`. `obscura_sustain` applies a continuous bowing force to maintain energy. A scanner sweeps across the chain at MIDI note frequency, reading displacements via cubic Hermite interpolation to produce audio-rate output — L channel scans forward, R channel scans backward. Boundary modes and initial chain shape determine fundamental timbral character. Two envelopes: amplitude and physics excitation.

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `obscura_stiffness` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Spring stiffness. Higher = brighter, more metallic harmonic content. |
| `obscura_damping` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.3 | Energy dissipation per step. Lower = longer sustain and ring. |
| `obscura_nonlinear` | 0–1 | 0.05–0.2 | Spring nonlinearity coefficient. Introduces inharmonicity and chaos. |
| `obscura_excitePos` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | Position on chain where impulse strikes. 0.5 = center. |
| `obscura_exciteWidth` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Width of the Gaussian impulse. Narrow = bright attack, wide = soft. |
| `obscura_scanWidth` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Scanner readout width. Narrow = bright, wide = darker Hann-windowed average. |
| `obscura_boundary` | Fixed/Free/Periodic | Fixed | Boundary conditions at chain ends. Fixed = string-like. Free = rod-like. Periodic = infinite loop. |
| `obscura_sustain` | 0–1 | 0.0–0.4 | Continuous bowing force applied to chain. 0 = impulse-only attack, >0 = sustained tone. |
| `obscura_initShape` | Sine/Saw/Random/Flat | Sine | Initial chain displacement shape at note-on. |

### Macros
- **CHARACTER** — drives obscura_stiffness + obscura_nonlinear (timbre hardness axis)
- **MOVEMENT** — drives obscura_scanWidth + LFO depth (animation)
- **COUPLING** — drives coupling send level
- **SPACE** — drives obscura_damping inverse + envelope release

### Coupling

- **Receives:** AudioToFM (applies external force to chain masses), AmpToFilter (modulates stiffness), RhythmToBlend (triggers impulse excitation)
- **Best as source for:** AudioToWavetable (scanned waveform as live wavetable source for other engines)

## 18. OCEANIC (Oceanic)
*Swarm particle synthesis — 128 oscillators that flock like creatures*

**Accent:** Phosphorescent Teal `#00B4A0` | **Prefix:** `ocean_` | **Voices:** Mono/Poly2/Poly4 (max 4)

### What It Does
128 oscillating particles per voice that self-organize using Craig Reynolds' boid flocking rules (separation, alignment, cohesion) plus an attractor anchored to the MIDI note frequency. Particles live in a 3D perceptual space — log-frequency, amplitude, pan. The emergent flocking behavior produces evolving, organic timbres impossible with static additive synthesis.

Two independent envelopes: **Amp ADSR** controls loudness; **Swarm ADSR** controls the *strength of the boid rules* — the collective intelligence of the school — entirely separately. At `ocean_swarmEnvSustain=0` the boid forces extinguish during sustain: particles drift freely while the note holds at full amplitude. At `ocean_swarmEnvAttack=2.5s` the school takes 2.5 seconds to learn to be a school — the attack is organic, scattered, then coheres into a tone. B013 Blessed: the Chromatophore Modulator — aftertouch boosts separation, modeling cephalopod color-shift physics.

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `ocean_separation` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.7 | How strongly particles repel nearby neighbors — spreads swarm spectrally |
| `ocean_alignment` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | How strongly particles match flock velocity — smooths collective motion |
| `ocean_cohesion` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | How strongly particles pull toward flock centroid — tightens the school |
| `ocean_tether` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.8 | Attractor strength toward MIDI note — lower = near-unpitched drift |
| `ocean_scatter` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.4 | Velocity-proportional note-on perturbation — harder hits scatter further |
| `ocean_subflocks` | 1–4 | 2–4 | Sub-flocks at 1×/2×/1.5×/3× MIDI frequency — emergent chord cluster |
| `ocean_damping` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | Velocity damping on particles — higher = slower, more sustained drift |
| `ocean_waveform` | 0–3 | 0–1 | Per-particle: 0=Sine, 1=Saw (PolyBLEP), 2=Pulse (PolyBLEP), 3=Noise |
| `ocean_swarmEnvAttack` | 0–5s | 0.05–2.5 | Time for boid forces to build to full strength after note-on |
| `ocean_swarmEnvDecay` | 0–5s | 0.1–1.0 | Time for boid forces to fall from peak to sustain level |
| `ocean_swarmEnvSustain` | 0–1 | 0.4–1.0 | Sustained boid force level. 0 = school dissolves, particles drift freely |
| `ocean_swarmEnvRelease` | 0–5s | 0.3–2.0 | Time for boid forces to extinguish after note-off |
| `ocean_lfo1Rate` | Hz | 0.01–10 | LFO1 rate — modulates separation |
| `ocean_lfo1Depth` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.4 | LFO1 depth on separation — breathing swarm |
| `ocean_lfo2Rate` | Hz | 0.01–10 | LFO2 rate — modulates cohesion |
| `ocean_lfo2Depth` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.3 | LFO2 depth on cohesion — tidal pull |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Post-limiter stereo swarm audio
- **Receives:** AudioToFM (velocity perturbation on all particles), AmpToFilter (modulates cohesion), RhythmToBlend (triggers **murmuration** — cascade reorganization of all 128 particles)
- **Best as source for:** Opal (swarm granulated), Overdub (swarm through tape delay)

### The Chromatophore (B013 Blessed)
Aftertouch (channel pressure) boosts separation ×0.25 — pressing harder makes particles scatter faster, exactly like a cephalopod accelerating chromatophore cycles under stress. Mod wheel (CC1) boosts cohesion ×0.4 — tightening the school. The two gestures are physical opposites: pressure scatters, wheel contracts.

### Murmuration
`RhythmToBlend` coupling triggers a cascade reorganization: a perturbation wave propagates from particle 0 through all 128 particles with 0.97× attenuation per particle. The first particles are maximally disrupted; the last barely moved. ONSET → OCEANIC via RhythmToBlend: every drum hit sends a murmuration wave through the school.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ Onset:** RhythmToBlend from Onset triggers murmuration — drums reorganize the swarm
- **+ Overdub:** Swarm audio through tape delay — organic dub textures
- **+ Opal:** Swarm output granulated — double-emergent cloud

### Starter Recipes
**Boid School:** ocean_subflocks=4, ocean_tether=0.6, ocean_separation=0.4, ocean_cohesion=0.5, ocean_waveform=0 (Sine)
**Chromatophore Pad:** ocean_separation=0.3, ocean_tether=0.7, ocean_cohesion=0.5 — use aftertouch for color
**Slow Cohere:** ocean_swarmEnvAttack=2.5, ocean_swarmEnvSustain=0.8, ocean_separation=0.5, ocean_cohesion=0.4
**Noise Flock:** ocean_waveform=3 (Noise), ocean_subflocks=4, ocean_tether=0.4, ocean_separation=0.6 — self-organizing texture

## 20. OBLIQUE (Oblique)
*Prismatic bounce engine — RTJ × Funk × Tame Impala*

**Accent:** Prism Violet `#BF40FF` | **Prefix:** `oblq_` | **Voices:** 8

### What It Does
Prismatic light bouncing off mirrors.

## 21. OMBRE (XOmbre)
*Dual-narrative synthesis — memory meets perception*

**Accent:** Shadow Mauve `#7B6B8A` | **Prefix:** `ombre_` | **Voices:** 8

### What It Does
A single engine containing two cognitive halves. **Oubli** (forgetting) captures audio into a circular memory buffer that gradually decays — granular reconstruction from dissolving traces. **Opsis** (seeing) is a reactive oscillator shaped by velocity transients — immediate, present-tense sound. The `blend` parameter crossfades between them. The `interference` parameter feeds each half into the other: Opsis output becomes Oubli's memory, and Oubli's ghosts haunt Opsis's pitch.

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `ombre_blend` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | Oubli ↔ Opsis balance. 0=pure ghost, 1=pure now. |
| `ombre_interference` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Cross-modulation between halves. Higher = more haunted. |
| `ombre_memoryDecay` | 0.01–30s | 2–8 | How fast Oubli forgets. Long = persistent ghosts. |
| `ombre_memoryGrain` | 5–500ms | 40–120 | Grain size for memory reconstruction. Small = glitchy, large = smeared. |
| `ombre_memoryDrift` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.4 | Pitch/time drift in memory. Higher = more degraded recall. |
| `ombre_oscShape` | 0/1/2/3 | — | 0=Sine, 1=Saw, 2=Square, 3=Triangle |
| `ombre_reactivity` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | How velocity shapes Opsis transient. Higher = more percussive. |
| `ombre_subLevel` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.4 | Sub oscillator level (one octave down, sine). |
| `ombre_filterCutoff` | 20–20kHz | 2–6 kHz | Shared LP filter cutoff. |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Envelope level (ch2), audio (ch0-1) — full-spectrum coupling source
- **Receives:** AmpToFilter (envelope → filter), LFOToPitch (pitch drift), AudioToFM (FM on Opsis), AudioToWavetable (external audio → Oubli memory)
- **Best as source for:** AmpToFilter (ghostly sidechain), AudioToWavetable (feed memories to other engines)

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ Opal:** Ombre provides the dissolving memories, Opal adds granular shimmer on top. Haunted ambient.
- **+ Odyssey:** Blend=0.7 (mostly Opsis), interference high — Drift's evolving pad feeds into Oubli's memory buffer via coupling. The pad remembers itself.
- **+ Optic:** AutoPulse modulates Ombre's filter cutoff. Memory buffer responds to visual rhythm.
- **+ Oblique:** Ombre's ghost output through Oblique's prism delay creates recursive memory echoes.
- **+ Organon:** Modal resonance feeds into Oubli memory — struck bells that slowly forget their pitch.

### Starter Recipes
**Ghost Pad:** blend=0.2, memoryDecay=12, memoryGrain=200, interference=0.4, oscShape=Saw, attack=0.5, sustain=0.8, release=2.0, filterCutoff=3000
**Reactive Lead:** blend=0.85, reactivity=0.8, oscShape=Saw, subLevel=0.4, interference=0.15, memoryDecay=1.5, attack=0.005, decay=0.2, sustain=0.7
**Dissolving Bells:** blend=0.5, memoryDecay=6, memoryGrain=30, memoryDrift=0.6, oscShape=Sine, reactivity=0.5, interference=0.5, filterCutoff=6000

## 22. OHM (XOhm)

**Accent:** Sage `#87AE73` | **Prefix:** `ohm_` | **Max voices:** 12 | **Macro axis:** MEDDLING / COMMUNE

### What It Is

OHM is the Hippy Dad of the Constellation Family — a physical modeling ensemble built around a folk-string waveguide core surrounded by eccentric in-laws. At rest it sounds like a single plucked or bowed instrument in a warm room. Push MEDDLING and the in-laws arrive: theremin interference, glass harmonica partials, a granular scatter engine. Push COMMUNE and they start listening to each other.

### DSP Engine

Karplus-Strong waveguide at the core: delay line → damping filter → body resonance filter → output. Body material (Wood/Metal/Gourd/Air) adjusts Q and resonance frequency. `FamilySympatheticBank` adds tuned secondary resonances; `FamilyOrganicDrift` adds continuous slow pitch microvariations. Three interference sources gated by MEDDLING: theremin sine oscillator, glass partial generator, and Hann-windowed grain engine (4.6B-state LCG seed). `OhmObedFM` — 2-operator FM with 8 selectable harmonic ratios (H 1:1 through Pu 11:6) — arrives only when MEDDLING > 0.7.

### Macros

**JAM (M1)** — Dad presence: scales waveguide output level. Automate for solo/verse dynamics.

**MEDDLING (M2)** — In-law threshold: below `ohm_meddlingThresh` all interference is silent; above it, theremin/glass/grain blend in proportionally. Obed FM arrives at 0.7+.

**COMMUNE (M3)** — Merges in-law interference into the Dad signal at low amplitude rather than adding on top. Full COMMUNE absorbs the in-laws into a modulated, beating complex string.

**MEADOW (M4)** — Scales reverb mix and delay feedback simultaneously. Low = dry living room; high = backyard dusk with long echoes.

## 23. ORPHICA (XOrphica)

**Accent:** Siren Seafoam `#7FDBCA` | **Prefix:** `orph_` | **Max voices:** 16 | **Identity:** Microsound harp, siphonophore

### What It Is

ORPHICA is a microsound harp — a waveguide plucked string with a per-voice grain processor that captures the string's own output into a circular buffer and plays it back as overlapping grain clouds. The string and cloud share the same voice and the same pitch. The result sits between a plucked instrument and a dispersed texture: precise in the transient, diffuse and shimmering in the sustain.

### DSP Engine

`PluckExciter` → Karplus-Strong waveguide → `FamilyDampingFilter` → `FamilyBodyResonance` → `FamilySympatheticBank`. String material (Nylon/Steel/Crystal/Light) adjusts damping and brightness. `FamilyOrganicDrift` adds continuous pitch microvariations. Per-voice `OrphicaMicrosound` engine: 8192-sample circular buffer, four simultaneous Hann-windowed grains. Four grain modes: Stutter (immediate repeat), Scatter (randomized read position), Freeze (locked read — instant drone), Reverse (reads backwards). FX chain splits at a configurable crossover note: LOW path (sub-octave, tape saturation, dark delay, deep plate reverb) vs HIGH path (shimmer reverb, micro delay, spectral smear, crystal chorus). LOW leans left, HIGH leans right for natural stereo imaging.

### Macros

**PLUCK (M1)** — Attack transient sharpness and exciter gain. Low = soft airy initiation; high = hard defined transient. Also energizes the sympathetic bank.

**FRACTURE (M2)** — Microsound intensity: adds to `orph_microMix` and increases grain scatter. At zero the grain layer is silent. Above 0.7 produces a grain storm on sustained notes.

**SURFACE (M3)** — Biases the crossover note split toward LOW (warm, reverberant) or HIGH (bright, shimmer, chorus-widened) FX path.

**DIVINE (M4)** — Scales shimmer reverb mix, deep plate mix, and spectral smear simultaneously. The atmosphere macro. Push to dissolve the instrument into a luminous field.

### Key Parameters

| `orph_subAmount` | 0–1 | Sub-octave sine in LOW path |
| `orph_shimmerMix` | 0–1 | Shimmer reverb in HIGH path |
| `orph_spectralSmear` | 0–1 | Granular dissolve on HIGH path output |

### Sound Design Recipes

**The Harp** — Material: Nylon. PLUCK 0.5, FRACTURE 0, SURFACE 0.5, DIVINE 0.25. Micro mix 0. Transparent, pitched, natural decay.

**Frozen Lake** — Micro mode: Freeze. PLUCK 0.3, FRACTURE 0.8, SURFACE 0.3, DIVINE 0.7. Micro mix 0.9, size 120ms, density 12. Play a chord, freeze it — drone persists under new notes.

**Shattered Glass** — Material: Light, mode: Scatter. PLUCK 0.9, FRACTURE 0.9, SURFACE 0.8. Scatter 0.8, rate 25 Hz, size 20ms. Clear initial note disperses into pitch-smeared debris.

**Crystal Delay** — Material: Crystal. PLUCK 0.7, FRACTURE 0, SURFACE 0.7, DIVINE 0.6. shimmerMix 0.5. Long glassy sustain with octave-up ghost from shimmer verb.

### Coupling

Accepts `LFOToPitch`, `AmpToFilter` (increases damping), `EnvToMorph` (scales pluck intensity). 16 voices and the dual LOW/HIGH stereo spread make ORPHICA a natural coupling source for OPAL or OVERWORLD's ERA crossfade.

## 24. OBBLIGATO (XObbligato)

**Accent:** Rascal Coral `#FF8A7A` | **Prefix:** `obbl_` | **Max voices:** 12 | **Identity:** Dual wind, BOND macro

### What It Is

OBBLIGATO is a dual wind instrument — two brothers sharing a waveguide. Brother A plays flute-family instruments (air jet exciter); Brother B plays reed-family instruments (reed exciter). They share a delay line and sympathetic resonance bank. The BOND system models their emotional relationship through eight stages (Harmony → Fight → Cry → Forgive → Protect → Transcend), reshaping breath, detune, sympathetic amplitude, and stereo width in real time.

### DSP Engine

Both brothers: same waveguide architecture (delay line → `FamilyDampingFilter` → `FamilyBodyResonance` → `FamilySympatheticBank`), different exciters. Brother A's `AirJetExciter` models air-jet/embouchure-hole nonlinearity; `ohm_airFlutterA` adds natural flute vibrato. Brother B's `ReedExciter` models a clamped-end vibrating reed; reed stiffness and bite control flexibility and harmonic content. Per-instrument body resonance ratios and Q values are instrument-specific (e.g., shakuhachi: 1.0× Q=5.0; ocarina: 0.6× Q=6.0; oboe: 1.8× Q=5; bassoon: 0.6× Q=3).

### Voice Routing Modes

Alternate (even→A, odd→B), Split (below C4→A, above→B), Layer (two voices per note, one from each), Round Robin (A-B-A-B), Velocity (soft→A, hard→B). Brother A pans to 0.35 (left of center), Brother B to 0.65 (right). BOND Fight stage pushes them to opposite sides; Transcend collapses to near-mono.

### Macros

**BREATH (M1)** — Global lung capacity: scales both brothers' pressure/breath parameters proportionally. Low = thin/airy; high = dense focused resonance.

**BOND (M2)** — Eight-stage emotional arc. Stage progression: Harmony(0) → Play(0.14) → Annoy(0.28) → Fight(0.43) → Cry(0.57) → Forgive(0.71) → Protect(0.86) → Transcend(1.0). Each stage reshapes detune, panning, sympathetic amplitude, and breath pressure.

**MISCHIEF (M3)** — Detuning chaos: A goes sharp, B goes flat by up to ±8 cents independently of BOND. Low = tight unison; high = beating chorus.

**WIND (M4)** — Band-limited noise floor (~1 kHz cutoff): environmental texture from dry studio to outdoor air.

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Function |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| `obbl_instrumentA` | 0–7 (choice) | Flute, Piccolo, Pan Flute, Shakuhachi, Bansuri, Ney, Recorder, Ocarina |
| `obbl_breathA` | 0–1 | Brother A air pressure |
| `obbl_embouchureA` | 0–1 | Embouchure quality — shapes resonance mode |

| `obbl_reedBite` | 0–1 | Reed harmonic edge above stiffness |
| `obbl_voiceRouting` | 0–4 (choice) | Alternate, Split, Layer, Round Robin, Velocity |
| `obbl_bondStage` | 0–1 | Continuous emotional stage (0=Harmony, 1=Transcend) |
| `obbl_bondIntensity` | 0–1 | Scale of all BOND emotional modulations |
| `obbl_bondRate` | 0.01–2.0 | Stage transition smoothing speed |

| `obbl_fxBSpring` | 0–1 | Brother B spring reverb |
| `obbl_macroWind` | 0–1 | Wind noise floor |

### Sound Design Recipes

**Morning Practice** — A: Bansuri, B: Duduk. Routing: Split. BREATH 0.5, BOND 0, MISCHIEF 0.05, WIND 0.4. Two instruments warming up — complementary body ratios in the low-mid register.

**The Argument** — Routing: Alternate. BOND 0.43 (Fight), MISCHIEF 0.8, WIND 0.15. Bond intensity 0.9, rate 0.05 (slow). Brothers detune and pan hard.

**Outdoor Transcendence** — BOND 1.0 (Transcend). A: Flute, B: Clarinet. Layer routing. BREATH 0.6, MISCHIEF 0, WIND 0.7. springReverb 0.5. Beatless unison with high wind ambience.

**Narrative Arc** — Draw BOND automation 0→1 over 8–16 bars at rate 0.01. The full emotional arc glides from Harmony through every stage to Transcend.

### Coupling

Accepts `LFOToPitch`, `AmpToFilter`, `EnvToMorph`. OBBLIGATO's stereo field (brothers panned L/R, widened by BOND fight stage) is a natural modulation source — coupling its amplitude to ORPHICA's `AmpToFilter` creates wind-driven harp decay shaping.

---

## 25. OTTONI (XOttoni)

**Accent:** Patina `#5B8A72` | **Prefix:** `otto_` | **Max voices:** 12 | **Identity:** Triple brass, GROW macro

### What It Is

OTTONI is a brass family portrait — three generations of players. Toddler (conch/vuvuzela/toy trumpet): all pressure and imprecision. Tween (trumpet/cornet/flugelhorn): finding the valve. Teen (French horn/tuba/ophicleide): disciplined, with vibrato. The GROW macro sweeps through these ages in a single gesture, morphing from loose and childlike to full and virtuosic.

### DSP Engine

All three voices share a `LipBuzzExciter` feeding a Karplus-Strong waveguide loop → `FamilyDampingFilter` → `FamilyBodyResonance` → `FamilySympatheticBank`. `LipBuzzExciter` receives an `ageScale` argument derived from GROW that shifts from loose/unfocused (low age) to tight/centered (high age). Teen voice has per-voice `vibPhase` accumulator — vibrato only appears as GROW approaches 1.0 via `growTeen` multiplier. Three-layer blend uses a triangular crossfade: toddler peaks at GROW 0, tween at 0.5, teen at 1.0 — intermediate values genuinely blend two age groups. Foreign Harmonics section: Stretch (delay line lengthened up to 10% — inharmonic partials), Drift (microtonal pitch wavering via sinusoidal delay modulation, up to 2 cents), Cold (body resonance shifted higher with sharper Q, up to +4 Q units).

### Macros

**EMBOUCHURE (M1)** — Global mouth-pressure multiplier: `(0.5 + EMBOUCHURE)` scales all three voices' individual pressure settings. Center = unmodified. Crescendo/decrescendo macro.

**GROW (M2)** — Engine's signature gesture: sweeps toddler→tween→teen via triangular crossfade. Teen vibrato appears only near 1.0. Automate across an entire arrangement for a developmental arc.

**FOREIGN (M3)** — Scales all three exotic deviations: Stretch (flat partials), Drift (microtonal wavering), Cold (nasal body resonance shift). Low = studio brass; high = ethnographic/unresolved.

**LAKE (M4)** — Reverb room size and delay mix (ping-pong stereo, 250ms, 60% feedback). Low = small room; high = alpine lake or cathedral.

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Function |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| `otto_toddlerInst` | 0–5 (choice) | Conch, Shofar, Didgeridoo, Alphorn, Vuvuzela, Toy Trumpet |
| `otto_toddlerPressure` | 0–1 | Toddler lip pressure |
| `otto_tweenInst` | 0–5 (choice) | Trumpet, Alto Sax, Cornet, Flugelhorn, Trombone, Baritone Sax |
| `otto_tweenEmbouchure` | 0–1 | Tween embouchure quality |
| `otto_tweenValve` | 0–1 | Valve modulation — subtle pitch wobble |
| `otto_teenInst` | 0–9 (choice) | French Horn, Trombone, Tuba, Euphonium, Tenor Sax, Dungchen, Serpent, Ophicleide, Sackbut, Bass Sax |
| `otto_teenEmbouchure` | 0–1 | Teen embouchure quality |
| `otto_teenBore` | 0–1 | Bore width — wider lowers damping and darkens tone |
| `otto_teenVibratoRate` | 3–8 Hz | Teen vibrato speed |
| `otto_teenVibratoDepth` | 0–1 | Teen vibrato depth (scales with GROW) |
| `otto_foreignStretch` | 0–1 | Partial detuning via delay line extension |
| `otto_foreignDrift` | 0–1 | Microtonal pitch drift |
| `otto_foreignCold` | 0–1 | Body resonance frequency shift + sharper Q |
| `otto_driveAmount` | 0–1 | Soft-clip (tanh) saturation on summed output |
| `otto_sympatheticAmt` | 0–1 | Sympathetic resonance amplitude |
| `otto_damping` | 0.8–0.999 | Feedback loop damping |

### Sound Design Recipes

**Coming of Age** — Automate GROW 0→1 over 8 bars. Toddler: Toy Trumpet, pressure 0.3. Tween: Cornet, embouchure 0.5. Teen: French Horn, bore 0.4. EMBOUCHURE 0.6, FOREIGN 0, LAKE 0.5.

**Distant Ceremony** — GROW 0.5. Toddler: Didgeridoo, Teen: Dungchen. FOREIGN 0.8, LAKE 0.9. Foreign cold + drift produces a distant ritual sound from no particular culture.

**Young Brass Section** — GROW 0.5. Tween: Flugelhorn, Teen: Euphonium (bore 0.7). Drive 0.15, LAKE 0.4. Warm, slightly unfocused brass pad.

**Old Horn Cold Day** — GROW 0.9. Teen: Serpent, bore 0.8. FOREIGN 1.0, LAKE 0.6. Vibrato rate 3.5 Hz. Strained nasal character of an old player on an old instrument.

### Coupling

Accepts `LFOToPitch`, `AmpToFilter`, `EnvToMorph`. Teen vibrato (pitch-modulating) coupling into OHM's `LFOToPitch` transfers teenage brass vibrato to the folk string — a cross-instrument expressive transfer unique in the fleet. OTTONI's harmonically dense drive-saturated output is well-suited as an audio source into OPAL's granular cloud.

---

## 26. OLE (XOlé)

**Accent:** Hibiscus `#C9377A` | **Prefix:** `ole_` | **Max voices:** 18 | **Identity:** Afro-Latin trio, DRAMA macro

### What It Is

OLE is an Afro-Latin string trio of three aunts — Tres Cubano (Cuba), Berimbau (Brazil), Charango (Andes) — plus three latent husbands (Oud, Bouzouki, Thai Pin) who arrive when DRAMA exceeds 0.7. The Alliance system formalizes disagreement: at any moment two aunts are paired against the third. SIDES sweeps through all three configurations; DRAMA raises the temperature and deploys the husbands.

### DSP Engine

All voices run a pluck/strum exciter into a Karplus-Strong waveguide loop. Voices 0–11 cycle between aunts (voice index mod 3). Voices 12–17 are husband voices, `isHusband` flagged, activated above DRAMA 0.7. Aunt 1 (Tres Cubano): `StrumExciter` — multi-pulse attack. Aunt 2 (Berimbau): `StrumExciter` with `coinPress` bending pitch up to +4 semitones, plus gourd size parameter shifting body resonance. Aunt 3 (Charango): per-voice `tremoloPhase` oscillator (5–25 Hz) amplitude-modulating output. Husbands use `PluckExciter` at 60% brightness average of Aunts 1 and 3. Stereo placement: Aunt 1 → 0.2 (far left), Aunt 2 → 0.5 (center), Aunt 3 → 0.8 (far right). Husbands center at 0.5. ISLA widens all positions proportionally.

### Macros

**FUEGO (M1)** — Strum exciter intensity for all aunts: directly scales `voiceBright × FUEGO` into the StrumExciter. Purely an attack macro — no effect on sustain or decay.

**DRAMA (M2)** — Emotional temperature. Below 0.7: no effect. Above 0.7: husband voices become active, scaling linearly 0→full at DRAMA 1.0. Individual husband levels set the final balance.

**SIDES (M3)** — Rotates through the three alliance configurations. At 0: Aunt 1 isolated, 2+3 paired. At 0.33: Aunt 2 isolated. At 0.67: Aunt 3 isolated. Intermediate values crossfade between adjacent configs. Sweeping in real time rotates dominant voice across stereo field.

**ISLA (M4)** — Stereo width: pushes Aunt 1 further left, Aunt 3 further right while Aunt 2 stays centered. Also reads as outdoor openness without adding reverb.

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Function |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| `ole_aunt1StrumRate` | 1–30 | Tres Cubano strum rate / attack energy |
| `ole_aunt1Brightness` | 0–1 | Tres Cubano pick brightness |
| `ole_aunt2CoinPress` | 0–1 | Berimbau coin press pitch bend (0 to +4 semitones) |

| `ole_allianceBlend` | 0–1 | Strength of alliance gain differential |
| `ole_husbandOudLevel` | 0–1 | Oud level when DRAMA > 0.7 |
| `ole_husbandBouzLevel` | 0–1 | Bouzouki level when DRAMA > 0.7 |
| `ole_husbandPinLevel` | 0–1 | Thai Pin level when DRAMA > 0.7 |
| `ole_sympatheticAmt` | 0–1 | Sympathetic resonance shared across all voices |
| `ole_damping` | 0.8–0.999 | Feedback loop decay |
| `ole_driftRate` | 0.05–0.5 Hz | Organic drift rate |
| `ole_driftDepth` | 0–20 cents | Organic drift depth |

### Sound Design Recipes

**The Aunts at Rest** — FUEGO 0.4, DRAMA 0, SIDES 0, ISLA 0.4. A1: bright 0.6, strum 6. A2: coinPress 0, gourd 0.5. A3: tremolo 10 Hz. Alliance blend 0.4. Balanced trio.

**Full Drama** — FUEGO 0.8, DRAMA 1.0, SIDES 0.3, ISLA 0.7. All husband levels 0.7. Full 6-voice cast — aunts in the outer field, husbands darkening the center.

**Berimbau Solo** — Aunt 1 + 3 levels 0. DRAMA 0. FUEGO 0.7. Alliance blend 0 (no differentiation). coinPress automated 0→0.8 over 4 beats. GourdSize 0.8. Pure coin-press pitch slides.

**Rotating Stage** — SIDES automated 0→1 over 8 bars. ISLA 0.6, alliance blend 0.7. Dominant voice rotates left→center→right without changing any notes.

### Coupling

Accepts `LFOToPitch`, `AmpToFilter`, `EnvToMorph`. Best coupling use: route OBBLIGATO's amplitude into OLE's `EnvToMorph` — wind duet dynamics drive strum intensity in real time. OLE's wide stereo field (especially at high ISLA) makes it a natural L/R anchor in a four-engine XOmnibus setup.

## 27. OVERLAP (XOverlap)

**Accent:** Bioluminescent Cyan-Green `#00FFB4` | **Prefix:** `olap_` | **Voices:** 6 | **Identity:** Lion's Mane jellyfish — knot-topology Feedback Delay Network synthesizer

### What It Does

OVERLAP is a 6-voice FDN (Feedback Delay Network) synthesizer whose routing matrix morphs between four mathematical knot topologies: Unknot, Trefoil, Figure-Eight, and Torus. Each voice is a pulsing oscillator fed through the shared FDN; the knot geometry determines how delay lines cross-feed each other. Voices couple via Kuramoto hydrodynamic entrainment — when `olap_entrain` is high, voice phases synchronize like bioluminescent pulses rippling through a jellyfish bell. A separate Bioluminescence layer adds shimmer above the FDN mix. Post-FDN processing runs through a Zavalishin TPT state-variable lowpass filter and a chorus/diffusion stage.

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Range | Default | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------------|
| `olap_knot` | Unknot / Trefoil / Figure-Eight / Torus | Unknot | FDN routing topology |

### Macros

| Macro | Parameter | What It Controls |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| `olap_macroKnot` (M1 KNOT) | 0–1 | Sweeps knot topology from Unknot → Trefoil → Figure-Eight → Torus while scaling tangle depth |
| `olap_macroPulse` (M2 PULSE) | 0–1 | Simultaneously raises pulse rate (0.01→8 Hz) and spread (0.3→1.0) |
| `olap_macroEntrain` (M3 ENTRAIN) | 0–1 | Sets entrainment coupling strength and raises FDN feedback proportionally |
| `olap_macroBloom` (M4 BLOOM) | 0–1 | Raises bioluminescence depth and opens filter cutoff |

### Expression

| Controller | Destination Options |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Mod Wheel (`olap_modWheelDest`) | Tangle / Entrain / Bioluminescence / Filter |
| Aftertouch (`olap_atPressureDest`) | Tangle / Entrain / Brightness / Pulse Rate |

### Coupling

OVERLAP accepts 7 coupling types from upstream engines:

| Incoming Type | Effect Inside OVERLAP |
|--------------|----------------------|
| `AudioToFM` | Modulates FDN delay base — audio-rate FM of the resonant network |
| `AudioToRing` | Ring-modulates the final stereo output |
| `AmpToFilter` | Opens filter cutoff proportionally to upstream amplitude |
| `EnvToMorph` | Pushes tangle depth toward more knotted topology |
| `LFOToPitch` | Maps pitch semitones to tangle depth perturbation |
| `PitchToPitch` | Same as LFOToPitch — semitone offset becomes tangle perturbation |
| `FilterToFilter` | Multiplicative filter cutoff shift from upstream filter state |

### The Knot Topology System

The FDN routing matrix is determined by `olap_knot` combined with `olap_tangleDepth`. At tangleDepth 0, all knot types reduce to the identity matrix (direct pass-through). As depth rises, the matrix morphs toward the full knot recirculation pattern:

- **Unknot** — simple loop topology; each delay feeds the next in a ring
- **Trefoil** — three-crossing alternating feedback; produces beating between voice pairs
- **Figure-Eight** — two-loop crossing at the center; creates a characteristic double-resonance density
- **Torus** — defined by P and Q parameters (`olap_torusP`, `olap_torusQ`); delay ratios are derived from the torus winding number, producing inharmonic frequency lattices at high feedback

The KNOT macro sweeps through all four sequentially — use it as the primary timbral morphing control for performances.

### Sound Design Recipes

**Bioluminescent Pad** — `olap_knot` Trefoil, tangleDepth 0.5, feedback 0.75, entrain 0.4, pulseRate 0.3 Hz, bioluminescence 0.4, filterCutoff 6 kHz, attack 400 ms, release 4 s. Mod wheel → Bioluminescence. Aftertouch → Entrain. Result: slow pulsing chordal shimmer that tightens phase-lock under pressure.

**Deep Tangle Drone** — KNOT macro 0.9 (Torus territory), delayBase 30 ms, feedback 0.92, dampening 0.7, entrain 0.8, BLOOM 0.6. Voices lock into a single breathing unit. Hold a low note for 8 bars and automate KNOT 0→1.

**FDN Percussion** — `olap_attack` 1 ms, decay 80 ms, sustain 0, release 100 ms, filterEnvAmt 0.9, filterEnvDecay 60 ms, knot Figure-Eight, delayBase 5 ms, feedback 0.4. PULSE macro 0.7. Short metallic transients with topology-defined pitch.

**Synchronized Pulse Field** — PULSE macro 0.5 (pulseRate ~4 Hz), ENTRAIN macro 1.0, spread 1.0, bioluminescence 0.3, filterCutoff 12 kHz. All 6 voices lock in phase and pulse together as a unified rhythmic texture.

## 28. OUTWIT (XOutwit)

**Accent:** Chromatophore Amber `#CC6600` | **Prefix:** `owit_` | **Voices:** Mono (4-note poly via 8 independent arms) | **Identity:** Giant Pacific Octopus — 8-arm Wolfram cellular automaton synthesizer

### What It Does

OUTWIT is an 8-arm synthesizer where each arm is an independent Wolfram elementary cellular automaton running its own Rule (0–255). The CA generates a 1D binary pattern; the arm reads pattern density and transition events to drive an oscillator, filter, and pitch. Arms are not merely layered — they communicate: the SYNAPSE parameter couples arm N's step event into arm N+1's state as an inter-arm excitation signal, creating a ring of eight distributed intelligence units. A global Amp Envelope shapes the composite sound per note. The SOLVE macro activates a genetic-algorithm hunt toward a target sonic DNA (6 descriptors: brightness, warmth, movement, density, space, aggression). An Ink Cloud module adds a separate decay tail on note trigger. Den Reverb is the on-board spatial processor.

### Per-Arm Parameters (x8, prefix `owit_arm0` through `owit_arm7`)

### Expression

Mod wheel adds up to +0.4 to `owit_synapse` — playing pressure increases inter-arm coupling, tightening the octopus's distributed intelligence. Aftertouch adds up to +0.3 to `owit_chromAmount` — pressure increases chromatophore modulation depth.

### Coupling

OUTWIT accepts 9 coupling types from upstream engines:

| Incoming Type | Effect Inside OUTWIT |
|--------------|---------------------|
| `AudioToFM` | Modulates step rate (±20 Hz) — upstream audio drives CA clock speed |
| `AmpToFilter` | Opens all arm filter cutoffs by up to +8 kHz |
| `EnvToMorph` | Increases chromatophore depth (up to +0.7) |
| `LFOToPitch` | Applies semitone pitch offset across all arms (±12 semitones) |
| `RhythmToBlend` | Increases synapse coupling (up to +0.5) — upstream rhythm tightens inter-arm sync |
| `AmpToChoke` | Scales arm levels down (inverse of amplitude — creates sidechain-like ducking) |
| `AudioToRing` | Ring-modulates arm output amplitude by upstream audio |
| `FilterToFilter` | Adds +4 kHz offset to all arm filter cutoffs |
| `PitchToPitch` | Adds harmony offset (+7 semitones) across all arms |

### The Wolfram CA System

Each arm maintains a 1D cellular array of length `armNLength`. At each CA step (rate = `owit_stepRate`), the engine applies the arm's Rule to generate the next row. Rules are standard Wolfram elementary CA: the next state of each cell is determined by the current state of the cell and its two neighbors, producing one of 256 possible rule tables. Key Rules for sound design:

- **Rule 110** — complex aperiodic patterns (Turing-complete); default arm 0
- **Rule 30** — chaotic, pseudo-random; default arm 1; useful for noise-like textures
- **Rule 90** — Sierpinski triangle fractal; default arm 2; strong rhythmic pulse at power-of-2 lengths
- **Rule 184** — traffic flow model; default arm 3; produces slow-moving density waves
- **Rule 60** — XOR fractal; default arm 4; creates repeating melodic sequences at short lengths
- **Rule 45** — complex/chaotic hybrid; default arm 5
- **Rule 150** — symmetric wave fractal; default arm 6
- **Rule 105** — complex aperiodic; default arm 7

The `owit_triggerThresh` parameter gates each arm: arm output is only produced when pattern density exceeds the threshold, creating natural rhythm from the CA dynamics.

### Sound Design Recipes

**Distributed Pulse** — All arm Rules set to defaults. stepRate 8 Hz, synapse 0.5, chromAmount 0.6, arm pitches: 0, 7, 12, 19, 24, 7, -12, -5 (octave + fifth spread). SYNAPSE macro 0.6. Arms phase-lock via synapse and produce a rhythmically interlocked harmonic stack.

**CA Drone** — Arms 0–3 active (levels 0.8), arms 4–7 at 0. stepRate 0.5 Hz, arm lengths 48–64, triggerThresh 0.1. DEN macro 0.7. Very slow CA evolution with dense sustain and full reverb — meditative texture.

**SOLVE Hunt** — Set target DNA: brightness 0.8, warmth 0.3, movement 0.9, density 0.6, space 0.4, aggression 0.7. SOLVE macro 0 → 1 over 8 bars. The GA progressively mutates arm rules and parameters toward the target — run live as a performance gesture.

**Ink Cloud Attack** — inkCloud 0.8, inkDecay 200 ms, ampAttack 1 ms, ampDecay 50 ms, ampSustain 0. Every note trigger fires a noise burst (ink) followed by the arm CA texture decaying quickly. Percussion from distributed intelligence.

**Synapse Ring** — stepRate 12 Hz, synapse 1.0 (SYNAPSE macro 1.0), arm pitches 0/2/4/7/9/12/14/16 (D major scale offsets). triggerThresh 0.2. Each arm immediately triggers the next; the ring propagates a traveling wave across the stereo field.

## OSPREY (Osprey)
*Turbulence-Modulated Resonator Synthesis — the surface hunter*

**Accent:** Azulejo Blue `#1B4F8A` | **Prefix:** `osprey_` | **Voices:** 8 (polyphonic, LRU stealing)
**Creature:** The osprey hunts at the boundary between air and ocean — the only raptor that plunges into water. XOsprey lives in the Surface zone: turbulent interface where wind meets wave, where resonance is born from chaos.
**Polarity:** Balanced feliX/Oscar — lives at the threshold between the two worlds
**Blessing:** B012 ShoreSystem — 5-coastline cultural data shared across engines

### What It Does
Turbulence-modulated modal synthesis shaped by five coastal resonator profiles (Atlantic, Nordic, Mediterranean, Pacific, Southern). A physics-inspired FluidEnergyModel replaces traditional oscillators — at low sea states it produces smooth sinusoidal swells; at high states it stacks 4 octaves of Perlin-style noise modeling the ocean energy cascade. Sixteen modal resonators per voice (3 instrument groups × 4 formants + 4 sympathetic strings) are excited by this fluid energy rather than a physical gesture.

Three creature formant voices per voice add the living element — birds, wind, distant calls. The ShoreSystem morphs between five coastal instrument families, smoothly transitioning the timbral DNA of a kora (Atlantic) into a koto (Pacific) as the Shore knob sweeps.

**Accent:** Porto Wine `#722F37` | **Prefix:** `osteria_` | **Voices:** 8 (polyphonic, LRU stealing)

**Polarity:** Balanced feliX/Oscar — communal, warm, accumulated history
**Blessing:** B012 ShoreSystem — shared with OSPREY, the OSPREY × OSTERIA diptych

### What It Does
A jazz quartet (Bass, Harmony, Melody, Rhythm) stretched across five coastal cultures via the ShoreSystem. Each voice independently absorbs local folk instrument character through formant resonator banks — Guitarra Portuguesa, Kora, Oud, Shakuhachi, Gamelan. Voices are connected by spring forces: elastic rubber-band coupling pulls them toward a shared centroid, creating tension when stretched and musical unity when tight.

Timbral memory means borrowed influences persist across notes — the quartet accumulates a living history of everywhere it's been. The Tavern Room is an FDN reverb with Householder-like mixing and per-shore absorption. Murmur generates crowd/conversation texture via filtered noise.

## OWLFISH (Owlfish)
*Mixtur-Trautonium Oscillator + Sacrificial Armor — the abyssal organ*

**Accent:** Abyssal Gold `#B8860B` | **Prefix:** `owl_` | **Voices:** 1 (monophonic)
**Creature:** The owlfish lives in the deep abyss — bioluminescent, heavily armored, predating in near-total darkness. Its Mixtur-Trautonium heritage makes it a creature of subharmonic stacks and resonant depth.
**Polarity:** Pure Oscar — the deep, the heavy, the organ of the abyss
**Blessing:** B014 Mixtur-Trautonium Oscillator — unanimous praise from the ghost council, genuinely novel

### What It Does
Monophonic organ synthesizer inspired by the Trautonium's subharmonic synthesis — a fundamental tone with a stack of integer-ratio sub-oscillators (the "Mixtur"). Each sub-oscillator runs at a division of the fundamental: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5 — Trautonium subharmonics, not octave doublings. The blend and level of each partial shapes the organ register: thin and reedy at top, massive and bowed at depth.

The Sacrificial Armor system is the owlfish's defense: a compressor-triggered scatter that breaks apart the signal when it comes under pressure, then reconstitutes it. Under soft dynamics, smooth and tonal. Under hard attack, the armor shatters into granular fragments before reforming.

Signal flow: Abyss Habitat (Mixtur oscillator stack) → Owl Optics (filter with keytracking) → Diet (spectral shaping) → Sacrificial Armor (compressor + scatter) → Amp Envelope → Abyss Reverb → Output.

## OCELOT (Ocelot)
*Forest Strata Synthesis — four ecosystem layers in cross-modulation*

**Accent:** Ocelot Tawny `#C5832B` | **Prefix:** `ocelot_` | **Voices:** polyphonic (voice pool)
**Creature:** The ocelot hunts across all forest layers — floor to canopy — moving between ecological strata with predatory precision. XOcelot models this as synthesis: four distinct synthesis layers (Floor, Understory, Canopy, Emergent) that cross-modulate each other through a 12-route EcosystemMatrix.
**Polarity:** Balanced feliX/Oscar — organic, territorial, layered

### What It Does
Four synthesis strata, each using a different synthesis approach, connected by a 12-route cross-modulation matrix. The Floor layer uses physical models (adjustable via `ocelot_floorModel`), the Understory provides rhythmic chopped texture, the Canopy delivers wavefold spectral shimmer, and the Emergent layer adds creature formant voices.

The Biome selector (`ocelot_biome`) morphs between forest biome character profiles — each biome shapes the timbral DNA of all four strata simultaneously. The EcosystemMatrix allows any stratum to modulate any other (12 cross-routes: Floor→Understory, Floor→Canopy, Floor→Emergent, Understory→Floor, etc.), creating complex internal ecosystems.

A lofi processing chain (bit depth reduction, sample rate reduction, tape wobble, tape age, dust) can give the entire engine a field-recording character — archival forest recordings.

## 29. ORCA — Apex Predator Synthesis

**Gallery code:** ORCA | **Accent:** Deep Ocean `#1B2838`
**Parameter prefix:** `orca_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The orca (killer whale) — apex predator of every ocean. Coordinated, intelligent, devastating. XOrca maps five biological subsystems directly into DSP: vocal dialect (wavetable + formant), echolocation (resonant comb), apex hunt macro (coordinated aggression), breach sub-bass (sidechain displacement), and countershading (band-split bitcrusher).
**Synthesis type:** Wavetable oscillator with 5-band formant network, resonant comb filter echolocation, sub-bass breach layer, dynamic bitcrushing with high/low band split

| `orca_macroSpace` | 0–1 | 0.0 | 0–0.5 |

### Macro Mappings
- **M1 CHARACTER**: Adds to `orca_huntMacro` aggression — drives filter cutoff, formant intensity, crush mix, breach sub, and echo resonance as a coordinated unit
- **M2 MOVEMENT**: Formant intensity offset + wavetable scan position + echolocation click rate — shapes how the pod vocalizes and hunts
- **M3 COUPLING**: Echolocation mix level — how much the comb-filter echo layer bleeds into the output and into coupling sends
- **M4 SPACE**: Registered macro; use for reverb/delay send depth in coupled configurations

### Coupling Compatibility
ORCA accepts: `AudioToFM` (modulates wavetable position via FM), `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude → formant intensity), `AmpToChoke` (external amplitude triggers breach sidechain), `EnvToMorph` (envelope → echolocation click rate modulation), `AudioToRing` (ring modulation source on the pod dialect layer), `LFOToPitch` (pitch modulation from upstream LFOs)

### Starter Recipes
**Pod Dialect:** orca_wtPosition=0.1, orca_formantIntensity=0.6, orca_formantShift=0.5, orca_glide=0.4, orca_echoMix=0.0 — pure vocal synthesis, orca click-calls without percussion; long glide for whale-song movement
**Echolocation Hunt:** orca_echoRate=12.0, orca_echoReso=0.92, orca_echoMix=0.4, orca_huntMacro=0.5 — rapid-fire comb pinging merges into metallic tones; HUNT at 0.5 adds aggression to filter and crush
**Breach Event:** orca_breachSub=0.8, orca_breachShape=0.0, orca_breachThreshold=-12.0, orca_breachRatio=12.0, orca_huntMacro=0.8 — massive sine sub displaces the mix on each note trigger; HUNT fully engaged for maximum countershading decimation

### Designer Notes
ORCA is an apex predator — it should never sound polite. The HUNT macro is the engine's identity: push it and everything moves as a single coordinated organism. Filter opens, formants intensify, echo rings harder, high-end gets crushed, sub displaces the bottom. It is designed to be pushed, not left at zero.

The wavetable + formant system (Pod Dialect) covers enormous timbral territory: sine-like whale calls at position 0, complex metallic vocal textures as position increases. Heavy portamento (`orca_glide` 0.3–1.0 seconds) transforms chromatic lines into the sliding pitch bends of actual orca vocalizations. Echolocation sits underneath as a resonant textural layer — at low rates it clicks, at high rates it rings. Mod wheel (CC#1) scans wavetable position live, enabling performance-time timbral sweeps from organic to metallic.

## 30. OCTOPUS — Decentralized Alien Intelligence

**Gallery code:** OCTOPUS | **Accent:** Chromatophore Magenta `#E040FB`
**Parameter prefix:** `octo_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The octopus — alien intelligence distributed across eight arms, each with its own neural cluster. XOctopus maps this directly: eight independent LFOs (arms) run at prime-ratio-related rates, modulating different sonic dimensions simultaneously.

It camouflages (chromatophore morphing filter), inks (velocity-triggered noise freeze), squeezes through microtonal gaps (shapeshifter), and grabs with wet suckers (fast bandpass transients).
**Synthesis type:** Wavetable oscillator with 8-arm polyrhythmic LFO modulation, envelope-follower-driven morphing filter (LP→BP→HP→Notch), velocity-triggered noise freeze burst, microtonal pitch drift + extreme portamento, ultra-fast bandpass transient layer
**Polyphony:** Mono / Legato / Poly8 / Poly16 (default: Poly8)

### Macro Mappings
- **M1 CHARACTER**: Arm modulation depth + sucker mix + filter cutoff/resonance — controls how much the decentralized arms impose themselves on the sound
- **M2 MOVEMENT**: Arm base rate + chromatophore adaptation speed + wavetable scan rate + chroma morph target — how fast the organism adapts and shifts
- **M3 COUPLING**: Chromatophore filter morph depth + ink cloud mix — how intensely the skin changes color and how readily it inks
- **M4 SPACE**: Ink cloud decay time extension + pitch drift — how long the ink cloud lingers and how far the pitch wanders between notes

### Coupling Compatibility
OCTOPUS accepts: `AudioToFM` (modulates wavetable position via FM — external audio shapes the oscillator timbre), `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude → chromatophore sensitivity, making the filter morph respond to upstream dynamics), `EnvToMorph` (envelope → arm rate modulation — upstream envelopes speed up the arm polyrhythm), `AudioToRing` (ring modulation on arm output amplitude), `LFOToPitch` (additional pitch modulation layered onto shapeshifter drift)

### Starter Recipes
**Alien Texture:** octo_armCount=8, octo_armSpread=0.7, octo_armBaseRate=0.8, octo_armDepth=0.6, octo_chromaDepth=0.5, octo_chromaSpeed=0.4 — all 8 arms running at prime-ratio rates with deep chromatophore adaptation; never repeats, never settles
**Ink Attack:** octo_inkThreshold=0.75, octo_inkDensity=0.9, octo_inkDecay=8.0, octo_inkMix=0.0 — hit keys at high velocity to trigger noise freeze; play softly for dry synth, slam hard for the ink cloud eruption
**Boneless Lead:** octo_shiftGlide=2.0, octo_shiftDrift=0.2, octo_shiftMicro=15.0, octo_suckerReso=0.85, octo_suckerMix=0.3 — extreme portamento with microtonal offset and sucker transients; slides through frequencies like a boneless body through a crack

### Designer Notes
OCTOPUS is the most generative engine in the fleet. The 8-arm LFO system operates independently — each arm runs at a prime-ratio multiple of the base rate (so arm ratios are 1×, 1.3×, 1.7×, 2.1×, 2.3×, 2.9×, 3.1×, 3.7× or similar), meaning the arms never exactly re-synchronize. The result is modulation that is always moving, always changing, but always internally coherent because it shares a common tempo reference. `octo_armSpread` is the key variable: at 0 all arms run at the same rate (synchronized), at 1 they diverge maximally.

The ink cloud is a performance weapon, not a mixing tool. Set `octo_inkThreshold` to 0.75–0.9 and leave `octo_inkMix` at 0. Play phrases normally; the ink only erupts when you play an accent note at maximum velocity. This creates dramatic contrast: melodic content suddenly obliterated by a wall of saturated noise that slowly dissolves. Pair with OPAL (granular) to freeze the ink cloud into indefinite sustain, or with OVERDUB (tape delay) to smear the noise into a murky wash.

## 31. OVERLAP — Knot-Topology Feedback Delay Network

**Gallery code:** OVERLAP | **Accent:** Phosphorescent Teal → Neon Green `#00FFB4`
**Parameter prefix:** `olap_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The Lion's Mane jellyfish — a drifting knot of trailing tendrils, thousands of filaments forming a single organism. OVERLAP maps three mathematical knot topologies (trefoil, figure-8, torus) directly onto the routing matrix of a Feedback Delay Network, so the loop geometry IS the sound.
**Synthesis type:** Knot-topology FDN — delay lines arranged as mathematical knot paths in 3D space, with up to 6 voices each running the same topology at different scales
**Polyphony:** Up to 6 voices (`olap_voices`)
**feliX-Oscar polarity:** feliX-leaning — curious, spatial, exploratory

### What It Does
OVERLAP's core insight is that a Feedback Delay Network is a spatial object: the delay lengths, feedback matrix, and routing define a geometry. By constraining that geometry to a mathematical knot path, the resonances, echo densities, and spectral colorations of the FDN take on the character of that knot's topology. The trefoil (topology 0) is the musical heart — three-lobed, balanced, resonant. The figure-8 (topology 1) is open and fluid, less dense, more spatial. The torus knot (topology 2) is the most complex: dense, self-intersecting, on the edge of chaos.

`olap_topology` is the primary identity switch — changing it mid-preset is a transformation, not a tweak. `olap_feedbackGain` controls how much energy recirculates through the knot paths; above 0.85 the network begins to self-oscillate in knot-specific patterns. `olap_modDepth` sweeps the delay-line lengths slowly, causing the knot to breathe and morph over time. With 6 voices active, each voice runs the same topology at a slightly different scale factor, producing rich spatial layering.

### Macros (Recommended)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **CHARACTER** | `olap_topology` (0→1→2 sweep) + `olap_feedbackGain` | The knot form — trefoil, figure-8, torus |
| M2 | **MOVEMENT** | `olap_modDepth` + mod rate | The jellyfish drift — knot breathing over time |
| M3 | **COUPLING** | Coupling send depth | Tendrils coupling into downstream engines |
| M4 | **SPACE** | `olap_voices` + voice spread | How many filaments, how wide the bloom |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Default | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `olap_topology` | 0/1/2 | 0 | 0 for music, 2 for texture | 0=trefoil (balanced), 1=figure-8 (open), 2=torus knot (dense) |
| `olap_feedbackGain` | 0–0.99 | 0.7 | 0.6–0.88 | Energy recirculation. Above 0.85: knot-pattern self-oscillation. |
| `olap_modDepth` | 0–1 | 0.2 | 0.1–0.5 | Delay-line length modulation. Makes the knot breathe. |
| `olap_voices` | 1–6 | 2 | 2–4 | Voice count. Each runs same topology at different scale. |
| `olap_lfo1Rate` | 0.01–5 Hz | 0.15 | 0.05–0.4 | Knot-breathing LFO rate. |
| `olap_filterCutoff` | 20–20000 Hz | 6000 | 2000–10000 | Output filter before coupling send. |
| `olap_level` | 0–1 | 0.8 | 0.7–0.9 | Output level. |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Stereo FDN output (post-filter), knot-resonance envelope
- **Receives:** `AudioToFM` (modulates delay-line length via incoming audio — external audio reshapes the knot geometry), `AmpToFilter` (upstream amplitude gates the feedback gain), `LFOToPitch` (pitch-shifts voice scale factors)
- **Best as source for:** `AmpToFilter` → OPAL or OVERDUB (knot resonance feeding granular freeze or tape smear)

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OPAL:** Knot resonances granularized. Spatial FDN captured mid-bloom and scattered across the stereo field.
- **+ OVERDUB:** Tape delay receiving OVERLAP's output — knot reflections smeared further through the delay path.
- **+ OCEANIC:** Two spatial engines in series. OCEANIC's separation field + OVERLAP's knot geometry = underwater topology.
- **+ ODYSSEY:** Open-water wavetable drift under the knotted FDN. Harmonic context beneath spatial texture.

### Starter Recipes
**Trefoil Bloom:** olap_topology=0, olap_feedbackGain=0.78, olap_modDepth=0.25, olap_voices=3 — three-lobed knot breathing gently; musical and spatial without chaos
**Figure-8 Space:** olap_topology=1, olap_feedbackGain=0.65, olap_voices=2, olap_modDepth=0.15 — open, airy, widest stereo image of the three topologies
**Torus Density:** olap_topology=2, olap_feedbackGain=0.84, olap_modDepth=0.4, olap_voices=6 — dense self-intersecting knot on the edge of self-oscillation; maximum filament bloom
**Self-Oscillation Edge:** olap_topology=0, olap_feedbackGain=0.93, olap_modDepth=0.05 — trefoil held just above self-oscillation threshold; sustained knot-resonance tones with no input

### Designer Notes
OVERLAP is a spatial and timbral engine, not primarily a pitch engine. The most productive approach is to establish topology first (that choice defines the character), then sculpt feedback gain second (that choice defines stability vs. chaos), then use mod depth to animate it over time. The trefoil is the workhorse — it is musical in the way a hall reverb is musical. The torus knot is the risk — beautiful when controlled, a wall of noise when feedback runs too hot. CPU load scales with voice count; 4 voices is the practical ceiling for most configurations.

## 32. OUTWIT — 8-Arm Wolfram Cellular Automaton

**Gallery code:** OUTWIT | **Accent:** `#CC6600` (Pacific Amber)
**Parameter prefix:** `owit_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The Giant Pacific Octopus — eight arms, each operating with partial autonomy from the central brain. OUTWIT maps this directly: eight independent arms each run a separate 1D Wolfram cellular automaton (rules 0–255), and the automaton states drive the synthesis parameters in that arm. The eight arms are summed, mixed, and sent to a 4-note polyphonic output.
**Synthesis type:** Wolfram 1D cellular automaton × 8 arms, 4-note polyphony per arm (32 voices maximum)
**Polyphony:** 4-note poly per arm × 8 arms
**feliX-Oscar polarity:** Deeply Oscar — alien, systematic, computational

### What It Does
Each arm runs an independent 1D cellular automaton — a row of binary cells updated each step according to a chosen rule. The rule number (0–255) determines the update table: which of the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhoods produce a live cell in the next generation. The resulting pattern of 0s and 1s is mapped onto synthesis parameters: pitch, amplitude, filter state, and modulation depth in that arm. `owit_rule` selects the same rule across all 8 arms. `owit_armDepth` (per-arm mix, 0–1) controls how much each arm contributes to the output mix.

Rule selection is the primary identity choice. Rule 30 is famously chaotic — pseudorandom behavior with no visible period. Rule 110 is the most complex: provably Turing-complete, producing self-replicating triangular structures that sound like irregular rhythmic patterns. Rule 90 is fractal (Sierpinski triangle), producing self-similar spectral densities. Rule 184 is the traffic-flow rule — alternating regions of density and silence. Rules 0–29 are sparse, producing only occasional triggers. Rule 255 sets all cells alive every generation and silences the output (all cells constant, no change, no modulation — a known gotcha).

### Macros (Recommended)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **CHARACTER** | `owit_rule` coarse sweep | The rule table — the octopus's instinct pattern |
| M2 | **MOVEMENT** | `owit_caRate` | How fast the automaton steps — nervous system tempo |
| M3 | **COUPLING** | Coupling send depth from arm mix | Arm output feeding downstream engines |
| M4 | **SPACE** | `owit_armDepth` spread (outer arms faded) | How many arms are audible — 2-arm to 8-arm spread |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Default | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `owit_rule` | 0–255 | 30 | 30 (chaos), 90 (fractal), 110 (complex), 184 (flow) | Wolfram rule. The primary identity switch. See rule notes above. |
| `owit_armDepth` | 0–1 (per arm) | 0.5 | 0.3–0.8 | Per-arm output mix depth. Arms 1–8 each have their own depth. |
| `owit_caRate` | 0.5–50 Hz | 8.0 | 2–20 | How fast the CA updates. Slow=rhythmic events, fast=tonal buzz. |
| `owit_voices` | 1–4 | 2 | 2–4 | Note polyphony per arm. |
| `owit_filterCutoff` | 20–20000 Hz | 8000 | 2000–12000 | Global output filter. |
| `owit_filterReso` | 0–1 | 0.0 | 0–0.5 | Filter resonance. |
| `owit_level` | 0–1 | 0.75 | 0.6–0.85 | Output level. |
| `owit_ampAttack` | 0–2 s | 0.01 | 0.005–0.1 | Per-arm amp envelope attack. |
| `owit_ampRelease` | 0–5 s | 0.3 | 0.1–1.0 | Per-arm amp envelope release. |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Arm mix stereo output, per-arm CA density (live 0–1 signal, useful as a modulation source)
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude modulates filter cutoff), `EnvToMorph` (upstream envelope shifts CA rate), `LFOToPitch` (pitch modulation across all arm voices)
- **Best as source for:** `AmpToFilter` → OPAL or OCEANIC (CA density as modulation signal)

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OPAL:** CA density triggers granular scatter bursts. Algorithmic intelligence seeds granular clouds.
- **+ ONSET:** Rhythmic CA patterns (Rule 184) synchronizing with ONSET drum voices. Traffic-flow rhythm meets percussion.
- **+ OCEANIC:** 8-arm alien intelligence beneath the phosphorescent ocean. Systematic pattern meets organic fluid field.
- **+ OPTIC:** CA cell states feeding OPTIC's visual engine. Cellular automaton made visible.

### Starter Recipes
**Chaotic Field:** owit_rule=30, owit_caRate=6.0, owit_armDepth=0.6 (all arms), owit_voices=2 — pseudorandom triggers across 8 arms; no periodicity, maximum unpredictability
**Fractal Shimmer:** owit_rule=90, owit_caRate=12.0, owit_armDepth=0.5, owit_filterCutoff=6000 — self-similar Sierpinski density; spectral content has fractal structure; bright and airy
**Traffic Pulse:** owit_rule=184, owit_caRate=4.0, owit_armDepth=0.7 (arms 1–4), owit_armDepth=0.2 (arms 5–8) — alternating density waves; closest OUTWIT gets to rhythmic regularity
**Complex Pattern:** owit_rule=110, owit_caRate=8.0, owit_voices=3, owit_armDepth=0.55 — Turing-complete rule; irregular self-replicating triangular patterns; unpredictable but internally structured

### Designer Notes
OUTWIT rewards deliberate rule selection above all other choices. Most of the 256 rules fall into four behavioral classes (Wolfram's classification): Class I (all cells die), Class II (stable repetition), Class III (chaotic), Class IV (complex). For musical use: Class III rules (especially 30, 45, 60, 86, 105) produce the most varied unpredictable patterns; Class IV (110 is the canonical example) produce the most musically interesting irregular structures. Rules 0, 255, 128 are edge cases — effectively silent or static. The `owit_caRate` parameter is a tempo control: at 1–4 Hz the automaton fires individual rhythmic events you can hear as discrete triggers; at 20+ Hz the updates blur into tonal buzzing. The transition zone (8–15 Hz) is where the most interesting textures live.

CPU load is real at 8 arms × 4 voices = 32 simultaneous voices. For most configurations, 4–6 arms with 2 voices each is the practical working range.

## 33. OSTERIA — ShoreSystem Cultural Synthesis

**Gallery code:** OSTERIA | **Accent:** Porto Wine `#722F37`
**Parameter prefix:** `osteria_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The Portuguese coastal culture — an osteria is a shoreline tavern, a place where fishermen return with the sea in their clothes. OSTERIA and OSPREY share the B012 ShoreSystem Blessing: five coastline cultural datasets (Atlantic Iberia, Pacific Japan, Indian Ocean Kerala, Mediterranean Greece, North Sea Norway) encoded directly into bass-register synthesis behavior.
**Synthesis type:** ShoreSystem shared with OSPREY — cultural coastline data encoded into resonance, bass character, and formant identity. Bass-register specialist.
**Polyphony:** Mono / Legato / Poly4
**feliX-Oscar polarity:** Oscar-leaning — grounded, coastal, weighted

### What It Does
Where OSPREY applies the ShoreSystem to its full harmonic range, OSTERIA focuses it specifically on the bass register. `osteria_qBassShore` is the engine's primary parameter: it encodes five distinct coastline cultural characters across its 0–1 range, each contributing different resonance profiles, sub-harmonic emphasis, and tonal weight that reflect that culture's marine relationship. Atlantic Iberia (around 0.0) is warm and resonant, built on the sustained tones of deep Atlantic swells. Pacific Japan (around 0.25) is tighter and more articulate, shaped by shorter wavelength coastal dynamics. Indian Ocean Kerala (around 0.5) is the most overtone-rich, dense with harmonic complexity. Mediterranean Greece (around 0.75) is dry and focused. North Sea Norway (around 1.0) is the coldest and most percussive — ice-coast bass.

`osteria_resonance` sculpts the modal quality within the chosen shore, and `osteria_depth` sets how much sub-bass energy the ShoreSystem contributes relative to the fundamental.

### Macros (Recommended)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **CHARACTER** | `osteria_qBassShore` | The coastline — cultural bass identity |
| M2 | **MOVEMENT** | `osteria_resonance` sweep | Shore resonance opening and closing |
| M3 | **COUPLING** | Coupling send depth | The tavern door — what bleeds out to other engines |
| M4 | **SPACE** | `osteria_depth` + reverb send | How much sub-bass fills the room |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Default | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `osteria_qBassShore` | 0–1 | 0.0 | All positions meaningful | Primary identity: 5 coastline cultural characters encoded across range |
| `osteria_resonance` | 0–1 | 0.5 | 0.3–0.7 | Modal resonance within chosen shore character |
| `osteria_depth` | 0–1 | 0.6 | 0.4–0.8 | Sub-bass ShoreSystem contribution vs. fundamental |
| `osteria_filterCutoff` | 20–1000 Hz | 300 | 80–500 | Bass-register output filter |
| `osteria_filterReso` | 0–1 | 0.1 | 0–0.4 | Filter resonance (bass resonance can overwhelm quickly) |
| `osteria_level` | 0–1 | 0.8 | 0.7–0.9 | Output level |
| `osteria_ampAttack` | 0–2 s | 0.02 | 0.01–0.1 | Amp envelope attack |
| `osteria_ampDecay` | 0–5 s | 0.5 | 0.1–1.5 | Amp envelope decay |
| `osteria_ampSustain` | 0–1 | 0.8 | 0.6–0.9 | Amp envelope sustain |
| `osteria_ampRelease` | 0–10 s | 0.4 | 0.2–2.0 | Amp envelope release |
| `osteria_lfo1Rate` | 0.01–5 Hz | 0.08 | 0.02–0.3 | Shore-swell LFO rate — slow amplitude modulation |
| `osteria_lfo1Depth` | 0–1 | 0.2 | 0.1–0.4 | Shore-swell LFO depth |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Bass register stereo output, shore-resonance envelope (slow-moving sub-bass dynamics)
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude → bass filter cutoff), `LFOToPitch` (pitch modulation), `EnvToMorph` (upstream envelope shifts shore blend position)
- **Best as source for:** `AmpToFilter` → any lead engine (OSTERIA's bass dynamics sidechain the lead filter)
- **Shared ShoreSystem (B012):** OSTERIA and OSPREY use the same underlying coastline dataset; coupling them creates a full-spectrum shore experience (OSPREY handles upper harmonics, OSTERIA handles bass)

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OSPREY:** Full ShoreSystem spectrum — OSPREY's upper harmonics + OSTERIA's bass = complete coastal identity. The natural pairing.
- **+ OVERDUB:** Porto Wine bass through tape delay. Warm, degraded, saturated — the music coming through a tavern wall.
- **+ ONSET:** Shore bass + percussive transients. Coastline rhythm section.
- **+ OCEANIC:** Deep bass beneath the phosphorescent field. Ocean floor and water column together.

### Starter Recipes
**Atlantic Iberia Bass:** osteria_qBassShore=0.05, osteria_resonance=0.55, osteria_depth=0.7 — warm, sustained, Atlantic warmth; the Douro estuary at dusk
**Pacific Japan Precision:** osteria_qBassShore=0.25, osteria_resonance=0.35, osteria_depth=0.5 — articulate, tighter decay, shorter sustain; Pacific directness
**Kerala Harmonic Depth:** osteria_qBassShore=0.5, osteria_resonance=0.7, osteria_depth=0.8 — overtone-rich, dense sub-harmonic field; the most complex shore character
**Norwegian Cold Coast:** osteria_qBassShore=0.98, osteria_resonance=0.25, osteria_depth=0.6, osteria_ampDecay=0.2 — coldest and most percussive; short decay, minimal resonance, ice-coast transient

### Designer Notes
OSTERIA is a bass instrument first. The temptation is to use it across the full frequency range, but its design — and the ShoreSystem's cultural data — is calibrated for the bass register. Set `osteria_filterCutoff` to 200–500 Hz and let the shore character define what happens below that ceiling. The B012 ShoreSystem Blessing was praised for encoding cultural and geographical data into synthesis behavior — honor that by treating `osteria_qBassShore` as a compositional choice about place, not just a timbre knob. Pair with OSPREY for a complete landscape; use OSTERIA alone when you need the weighted, grounded character of a coastal tavern without the full horizon.

## 34. OWLFISH — Mixtur-Trautonium Synthesis

**Gallery code:** OWLFISH | **Accent:** Abyssal Gold `#B8860B`
**Parameter prefix:** `owl_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The owlfish (Symbolophorus) — a deep-ocean lanternfish, barely seen, predating bioluminescence research, carrying its own abyssal light. OWLFISH carries the B014 Blessing: a genuine Mixtur-Trautonium oscillator architecture, unanimously praised by the ghost council. The Trautonium (Oskar Sala's instrument) used a fixed oscillator divided by integer ratios to produce its characteristic subharmonic spectrum.
**Synthesis type:** Mixtur-Trautonium — fixed-frequency main oscillator divided by integer ratios (÷2 through ÷9), 3 independent divider channels, morphable filter, duophonic
**Polyphony:** Duophonic (2 simultaneous notes — the Trautonium's characteristic)
**feliX-Oscar polarity:** Oscar-leaning — abyssal, systematic, luminous in the dark

### What It Does
`owl_bodyFreq` is a fixed sine oscillator — not a MIDI-pitched tone but a compositional choice about a frequency in Hz. This is the engine's defining feature and its most important departure from conventional synthesis: you set the oscillator frequency manually, and MIDI notes shift it relative to that anchor, OR you use `owl_bodyFreq` as a fixed drone and play overtones above it with the dividers. The ghost council's OWL-I finding names this explicitly: "bodyFreq IS a compositional decision."

Three divider channels (`owl_divider1`, `owl_divider2`, `owl_divider3`) each select an integer divisor from ÷2 to ÷9. The output of each divider is a subharmonic of the body frequency — `÷2` gives an octave below, `÷3` gives a subharmonic fifth (a ratio not in the standard harmonic series), `÷5` and `÷7` are the Oskar Sala territory: odd-integer subharmonics that produce the instrument's distinctively unsettling, non-tempered intervals. The OWL-III scripture is unambiguous: odd dividers (÷3, ÷5, ÷7) are the Trautonium's uncanny identity; even dividers (÷2, ÷4, ÷8) are musically conventional but lack the character.

`owl_morphGlide` is the OWL-IV parameter: it controls the rate at which the filter morphs between configurations when you change divider settings or shift bodyFreq — a slow glide creates the metamorphosis effect Sala used in his Rosenmontag suite recordings.

### Macros (Recommended)
| Macro | Name | Mapping | Aquatic Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **CHARACTER** | `owl_divider1`/`owl_divider2`/`owl_divider3` combined | The subharmonic chord — which depths the owlfish illuminates |

| M3 | **COUPLING** | Coupling send depth | Abyssal light reaching other engines |
| M4 | **SPACE** | `owl_filterCutoff` + reverb send | How much the abyssal spectrum opens and breathes |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Default | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `owl_bodyFreq` | 20–2000 Hz | 110 | 55–440 | Fixed main oscillator frequency. Compositional choice, not a root note. |
| `owl_divider1` | 2–9 | 2 | 2 (musical), 3/5/7 (uncanny) | Subharmonic divider channel 1. Integer ratio. |
| `owl_divider2` | 2–9 | 3 | 3/5 for Trautonium character | Subharmonic divider channel 2. |
| `owl_divider3` | 2–9 | 5 | 5/7 for deepest Sala territory | Subharmonic divider channel 3. |
| `owl_divider1Level` | 0–1 | 0.8 | 0.5–1.0 | Level of divider channel 1. |
| `owl_divider2Level` | 0–1 | 0.6 | 0.3–0.8 | Level of divider channel 2. |
| `owl_divider3Level` | 0–1 | 0.4 | 0.2–0.7 | Level of divider channel 3. |
| `owl_filterCutoff` | 20–8000 Hz | 2000 | 500–4000 | Trautonium filter (colored the instrument's characteristic tone) |
| `owl_filterReso` | 0–1 | 0.3 | 0.2–0.6 | Filter resonance |
| `owl_morphGlide` | 0–10 s | 1.5 | 0.5–5.0 | Filter/spectrum metamorphosis glide time (OWL-IV) |
| `owl_level` | 0–1 | 0.8 | 0.7–0.9 | Output level |
| `owl_ampAttack` | 0–5 s | 0.05 | 0.01–0.5 | Amp envelope attack |
| `owl_ampDecay` | 0–10 s | 0.5 | 0.1–2.0 | Amp envelope decay |
| `owl_ampSustain` | 0–1 | 0.7 | 0.5–0.85 | Amp envelope sustain |
| `owl_ampRelease` | 0–20 s | 1.0 | 0.3–5.0 | Amp envelope release — Trautonium releases are characteristically slow |
| `owl_lfo1Rate` | 0.01–5 Hz | 0.2 | 0.05–0.8 | Body-frequency LFO (vibrato — Sala used it sparingly) |
| `owl_lfo1Depth` | 0–1 | 0.1 | 0.05–0.3 | LFO depth. Keep subtle — Trautonium vibrato was a nuance, not a feature. |

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Stereo divider mix output, `owl_bodyFreq` as a CV-style pitch signal (useful for coupling to engines expecting a slow-moving frequency reference)
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude → filter cutoff — Sala's own ribbon controller shaped the filter dynamically), `LFOToPitch` (modulates bodyFreq — treats the fixed oscillator as a drifting reference), `EnvToMorph` (upstream envelope accelerates morphGlide)
- **Best as source for:** `AmpToFilter` → OCEANIC or OVERDUB (owlfish abyssal light modulating other engines' spectral depth)

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OVERDUB:** Trautonium tones through tape delay. Oskar Sala's instrument + Vangelis's delay aesthetic. Abyssal time.
- **+ OCEANIC:** Fixed subharmonic spectrum beneath the phosphorescent ocean field. OWLFISH as harmonic anchor, OCEANIC as motion.
- **+ ORACLE:** GENDY stochastic synthesis above a Trautonium fixed bass. Two alien synthesis paradigms in one signal chain.
- **+ OPAL:** Granular engine sampling the owlfish spectrum. Trautonium tones frozen and scattered into grain clouds.

### Starter Recipes
**Classic Trautonium:** owl_bodyFreq=110, owl_divider1=2, owl_divider2=3, owl_divider3=5, owl_filterCutoff=1800, owl_filterReso=0.35 — the canonical subharmonic stack; ÷2 adds an octave below, ÷3 and ÷5 add the odd Sala intervals; warm, weighted, slightly unsettling
**Sala Territory (Odd Only):** owl_bodyFreq=82, owl_divider1=3, owl_divider2=5, owl_divider3=7, owl_divider1Level=0.9, owl_divider2Level=0.7, owl_divider3Level=0.5 — all three channels on odd divisors; maximum Trautonium uncanniness; non-tempered subharmonic stack
**Metamorphosis:** owl_morphGlide=4.0, owl_bodyFreq=165, owl_divider1=2, owl_divider2=3, owl_divider3=5, owl_filterCutoff=3000 — long morphGlide; changing any divider produces a slow transformation rather than an abrupt shift; OWL-IV technique
**Abyssal Drone:** owl_bodyFreq=55, owl_divider1=2, owl_divider2=5, owl_divider3=7, owl_divider3Level=0.3, owl_ampSustain=1.0, owl_ampRelease=6.0 — 55 Hz fixed anchor; odd subharmonics below 28 Hz; held drone that breathes with LFO; MIDI pitch ignored in drone mode

### Designer Notes
OWLFISH demands that you approach `owl_bodyFreq` as a compositional decision before you touch anything else. Choose a frequency that fits your key or drone: 55 Hz (A1) for deep bass, 110 Hz (A2) for cello register, 165 Hz (E3) for a slightly higher anchor. That frequency IS the instrument. The dividers then build a subharmonic structure beneath it that is entirely determined by integer mathematics — not by equal temperament, not by standard intervals. This is why ÷3 and ÷5 feel uncanny: they produce ratios that do not appear in 12-tone equal temperament and never will.

The duophonic architecture (OWL-II) means OWLFISH can voice two independent bodyFreq+divider configurations simultaneously. Use this for internal harmony or for a Trautonium-style melody-plus-drone texture. Keep morphGlide between 1–4 seconds for the metamorphosis character; shorter is more mechanical, longer approaches a slow vowel-like spectral drift. Velocity should shape filter brightness (D001) — higher velocity opens the filter, simulating the Trautonium's pressure-sensitive ribbon dynamic.

## 35. OSTINATO — World Drum Circle Synthesis

**Gallery code:** OSTINATO | **Accent:** Firelight Orange `#E8701A`

**Identity:** The fire at the center of the drum circle — 8 seats, 12 world instruments, each physically modeled with modal membrane resonators and waveguide body resonance. The most complex percussive engine in the fleet. Ostinato plays autonomously or responds to MIDI; the GATHER macro sweeps from loose/organic to locked/quantized.

**Macros**
| Macro | Name | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| M1 | **CHARACTER** (GATHER) | Ensemble tightness — loose/organic → locked/quantized |
| M2 | **MOVEMENT** (FIRE) | Intensity — exciter energy, resonance, dynamics compression |
| M3 | **COUPLING** (CIRCLE) | Inter-seat sympathetic resonance and ghost triggers |
| M4 | **SPACE** | Environment — dry room → cathedral reverb |

**Key Parameters**
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------------|
| `osti_seat{N}Instrument` | 0–11 | Mix traditions | Which world instrument sits at seat N (0=Djembe … 11=Beatbox) |
| `osti_seat{N}Pattern` | 0–7 | 0=foundational | Which of 8 embedded patterns this seat plays |
| `osti_gather` | 0–1 | 0.4–0.6 | Ensemble tightness — at 0: loose/humanized; at 1: perfectly locked |
| `osti_fire` | 0–1 | 0.5–0.8 | Global intensity — drives exciter level and dynamic compression |
| `osti_circle` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Sympathetic resonance between seats (ghost triggers, cross-excitation) |
| `osti_tempo` | 20–300 BPM | Host-synced | Pattern sequencer tempo (or host-sync) |
| `osti_brightness` | 0–1 | 0.4–0.7 | Radiation filter brightness across all seats |
| `osti_reverbMix` | 0–1 | 0.15–0.4 | Room environment blend |

**Coupling**
- **Sends:** Stereo percussive mix; amplitude envelope (useful as a rhythmic gate for other engines)
- **Receives:** `EnvToMorph` (modulates CIRCLE resonance depth), `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude brightens radiation filter), `LFOToPitch` (subtle pitch drift on membrane resonators — adds bowl-drum quality)
- **Best as source for:** `AmpToFilter` → OPAL (rhythm gates grain density), `AudioToFM` → ODYSSEY (percussive transients drive FM modulation)

**Recommended Pairings**
- **+ OPAL:** OSTINATO amplitude as grain-density gate — drums literally scatter OPAL's granular cloud
- **+ OCEANIC:** Percussive hits through the phosphorescent ocean field — transient smearing
- **+ OVERDUB:** Tape delay on the drum output — organic rhythm with trailing character
- **+ ORGANON:** Metabolic LFO from ORGANON driving OSTINATO's FIRE macro — breathing rhythm intensity

**Starter Recipes**
**West Africa Circle:** Seat 0=Djembe/Pattern 0, Seat 1=Dundun/Pattern 0, Seat 2=Djembe/Pattern 1 — the canonical 12/8 feel; add CIRCLE=0.3 for ghost sympathetics
**Global Fusion:** Mix Djembe (0), Tabla (6), Doumbek (7), Tongue Drum (10) — four traditions in one circle; GATHER=0.5 for intentional rhythmic tension
**Beatbox Core:** Seat 0=Beatbox/Pattern 0 as kick/snare backbone, Seat 1=Djembe for texture, FIRE=0.8 — accessible modern groove with acoustic warmth underneath
**Ambient Pulse:** All seats on Pattern 3 (sparse), GATHER=0.2, CIRCLE=0.6, SPACE=0.8 — barely-there rhythm that exists more as atmosphere than beat

**Designer Notes**
OSTINATO rewards seat assignment as a compositional act. Choose instruments that span geographic traditions — a djembe beside a tabla beside a doumbek creates rhythmic cross-pollination that no single tradition provides. The GATHER macro is the key creative axis: below 0.4, the circle feels like a live ensemble with human variation; above 0.7, it locks into a machine-tight grid. The sweet spot between 0.4–0.6 is where the magic lives — organized enough to feel intentional, loose enough to breathe. CIRCLE at moderate amounts creates sympathetic ghost hits: one drum's resonance triggers neighboring seats at low velocity, producing organic fills that emerge from the physics rather than the pattern.

## 36. OPENSKY — Euphoric Shimmer Synthesis

**Gallery code:** OPENSKY | **Accent:** Sunburst `#FF8C00`

**Identity:** The flying fish — leaping from water into air, wings spread against the sun. Pure feliX polarity. A supersaw-plus-shimmer engine for anthemic pads, crystalline leads, and euphoric ascension. Seven detuned saws into shimmer reverb (octave-up + fifth-up pitch-shifted tails) into stereo chorus into unison stack.

**Macros**
| Macro | Name | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| M1 | **CHARACTER** (RISE) | Pitch envelope up + filter opens + shimmer increases |
| M2 | **MOVEMENT** (WIDTH) | Chorus depth + unison stereo spread |
| M3 | **COUPLING** (GLOW) | Shimmer tail length + feedback amount |
| M4 | **SPACE** (AIR) | Reverb size + high-frequency content boost |

**Key Parameters**
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------------|
| `sky_detune` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Supersaw stack detune — 0: unison; 1: wide chorus beat |
| `sky_filterCutoff` | 20–20k Hz | 2k–8k | Bright filter cutoff — the tonal center of the shimmer |
| `sky_filterRes` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.3 | Filter resonance — keep low for anthem pads |
| `sky_shimmerMix` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | Shimmer reverb wet amount |
| `sky_shimmerSize` | 0–1 | 0.5–0.8 | Shimmer tail length |
| `sky_chorusDepth` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Chorus modulation depth |
| `sky_chorusRate` | 0–5 Hz | 0.3–1.0 | Chorus LFO rate |
| `sky_unisonVoices` | 1–7 | 3–5 | Unison stack voice count |
| `sky_unisonSpread` | 0–1 | 0.4–0.7 | Stereo spread of unison voices |
| `sky_ampAttack` | 0–10 s | 0.5–3.0 | Attack time — OPENSKY rewards slow attacks |
| `sky_lfo1Rate` | 0.01–5 Hz | 0.05–0.3 | Breathing LFO rate (D005 floor: 0.01 Hz) |
| `sky_lfo1Depth` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.3 | LFO depth — filter shimmer undulation |

**Coupling**
- **Sends:** Stereo shimmer output; amplitude envelope
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude modulates filter cutoff), `LFOToPitch` (pitch drift from partner engines), `AudioToFM` (FM modulation on supersaw stack), `PitchToPitch` (harmony — key coupling with OCEANDEEP)
- **Key coupling:** OPENSKY × OCEANDEEP = **"The Full Column"** — sky feeds pitch harmony down, deep feeds sub rumble up; together they span the full frequency and emotional range of the mythology

**Recommended Pairings**
- **+ OCEANDEEP:** The Full Column. OPENSKY handles euphoric highs, OCEANDEEP provides crushing lows. Send OCEANDEEP's envelope to OPENSKY's filter for dynamic sub-to-shimmer movement.
- **+ OPAL:** OPENSKY pads feeding OPAL's grain buffer — shimmer frozen and scattered into clouds
- **+ ORBITAL:** Both engines are group-envelope-centric. ORBITAL's Group Envelope driving OPENSKY's RISE macro creates synchronized ascension arcs.
- **+ ODYSSEY:** Drift engine beneath the shimmer — ODYSSEY's analog warmth grounds OPENSKY's digital brightness

**Starter Recipes**
**Anthem Pad:** sky_detune=0.4, sky_shimmerMix=0.5, sky_unisonVoices=5, sky_ampAttack=2.0 — the canonical euphoric pad; wide, shimmering, never harsh
**Crystal Lead:** sky_detune=0.2, sky_filterCutoff=5000, sky_shimmerMix=0.3, sky_unisonVoices=3 — focused and melodic; shimmer adds air without obscuring pitch
**Infinite Ascent:** RISE macro at 0.8, sky_ampAttack=4.0, sky_shimmerSize=0.9, sky_lfo1Rate=0.02 — holds forever; breathes imperceptibly; never resolves
**Full Column:** OPENSKY paired with OCEANDEEP, PitchToPitch coupling at 0.7 — sky and abyss in simultaneous voice; the full XO_OX water column, surface to trench

**Designer Notes**
OPENSKY is unapologetically euphoric — it makes no pretense of darkness or complexity. Its power is in layering: the supersaw stack provides harmonic mass, the shimmer stage adds pitch-shifted reflections that make simple chords feel orchestral, and the unison engine widens everything into a wall of sound. Velocity shapes filter brightness (D001): soft touches yield warm, filtered pads; hard strikes open the filter and increase shimmer intensity. The key creative decision is how much shimmer to use — at low values (0.2–0.4) it adds air without calling attention to itself; at high values (0.7+) the pitch-shifted tails become a feature, adding intervals that weren't played. The Full Column pairing with OCEANDEEP is the intended complete system: let OPENSKY handle everything above 200 Hz and OCEANDEEP handle everything below.

---

## 37. OCEANDEEP — Abyssal Bass Synthesis

**Gallery code:** OCEANDEEP | **Accent:** Trench Violet `#2D0A4E`

**Identity:** Pure Oscar polarity. The deepest, darkest engine in the XO_OX water column — modeling the hadal zone (6000–11000m). Three-oscillator sub engine, hydrostatic compressor that increases ratio with PRESSURE, waveguide body resonance (Shipwreck / Cave / Trench), bioluminescent exciter transients, and creature LFOs with sub-0.01 Hz drift.

**Macros**
| Macro | Name | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| M1 | **CHARACTER** (PRESSURE) | Depth/weight — drives compressor, filter darkness, sub level |
| M2 | **MOVEMENT** (CREATURE) | Alien life modulation — LFO depth, exciter probability |
| M3 | **COUPLING** (WRECK) | Environment resonance — body type blend, resonance intensity |
| M4 | **SPACE** (ABYSS) | Vastness — reverb size, pre-delay, darkness |

**Key Parameters**
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------------|
| `deep_osc1Wave` | 0–2 | 0=sine | Sub osc 1 waveform (sine/triangle/square) |
| `deep_osc2Wave` | 0–2 | 1=triangle | Sub osc 2 waveform |
| `deep_subLevel` | 0–1 | 0.6–1.0 | Sub-harmonic generator level (octave below) |
| `deep_pressure` | 0–1 | 0.4–0.8 | Hydrostatic compressor depth — logarithmic ratio increase |
| `deep_bodyType` | 0–2 | 2=Trench | Body resonance type: 0=Shipwreck, 1=Cave, 2=Trench |
| `deep_wreck` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Body resonance intensity |
| `deep_creatureLfo1Rate` | 0.001–0.1 Hz | 0.005–0.02 | Creature LFO 1 rate (D005: below 0.01 Hz floor) |
| `deep_exciterProb` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.4 | Bioluminescent exciter trigger probability |
| `deep_filterCutoff` | 20–2000 Hz | 100–600 | Darkness filter cutoff — pressure darkens this automatically |
| `deep_ampAttack` | 0–10 s | 0.1–2.0 | Amp envelope attack |
| `deep_ampRelease` | 0–20 s | 1.0–8.0 | Amp envelope release — abyssal sounds decay slowly |

**Coupling**
- **Sends:** Post-process stereo audio (ch 0/1), envelope level (ch 2)
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (modulates darkness filter cutoff), `LFOToPitch` (creature pitch warping), `AudioToFM` (FM input to sub oscillators), `EnvToDecay` (modulates body resonance decay)
- **Key coupling:** OCEANDEEP × OPENSKY = **"The Full Column"** — send OPENSKY's envelope to OCEANDEEP's filter for surface-to-trench movement

**Recommended Pairings**
- **+ OPENSKY:** The Full Column. Together they span the complete mythological range — surface shimmer above, abyssal pressure below.
- **+ OUROBOROS:** OUROBOROS chaotic instability feeds into OCEANDEEP's FM input — sub bass that writhes and mutates
- **+ OPAL:** OCEANDEEP sub content frozen into OPAL grain buffers — low-frequency granular rumble
- **+ OSTINATO:** Drum circle above an ocean trench — OSTINATO's rhythmic transients against OCEANDEEP's continuous pressure

**Starter Recipes**
**Abyssal Foundation:** deep_osc1Wave=sine, deep_pressure=0.7, deep_bodyType=2 (Trench), deep_subLevel=0.9 — maximum depth; the trench body gives a vast, metallic resonance to sustained bass
**Creature Pulse:** deep_creatureLfo1Rate=0.008, deep_exciterProb=0.3, deep_creature=0.6 — bioluminescent flashes emerge unpredictably from the darkness; organic, alive, unsettling
**Shipwreck Resonance:** deep_bodyType=0, deep_wreck=0.7, deep_pressure=0.5 — metallic, short resonance; industrial bass with history
**Full Column (with OPENSKY):** PitchToPitch coupling 0.7, OCEANDEEP PRESSURE=0.6, OPENSKY RISE=0.5 — the complete XO_OX water column

**Designer Notes**
OCEANDEEP is a bass instrument first and a synthesis engine second. Approach it as you would a sub-bass oscillator that happens to have a biome. The PRESSURE macro is the primary voice — as you increase it, the compressor crushes harder, the filter darkens, and the sub level increases; you are literally descending. The bioluminescent exciter is subtle by design: at low probability (0.1–0.2) it adds occasional noise bursts that feel like creatures passing through the dark — not a feature, more a presence. Body type is the most dramatic timbre choice: Shipwreck gives a metallic, resonant character (think Vangelis's industrial bass); Cave rounds and deepens it; Trench is massive and nearly pitch-less at its extreme. The Full Column pairing with OPENSKY is the canonical complete patch — do not hesitate to start there.

## 38. OUIE — Duophonic Hammerhead Synthesis

**Gallery code:** OUIE | **Accent:** Hammerhead Steel `#708090`

**Identity:** The hammerhead shark at the thermocline — neither bright nor dark, sitting at perfect 50/50 feliX-Oscar polarity. Two voices, each running one of 8 algorithms (VA/Wavetable/FM/Additive on the smooth side; Phase Distortion/Wavefolder/Karplus-Strong/Noise on the rough side). The HAMMER macro sweeps from STRIFE (cross-FM + ring modulation, destructive) to LOVE (spectral blend + harmonic lock, constructive).

**Macros**
| Macro | Name | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| M1 | **CHARACTER** (HAMMER) | STRIFE↔LOVE — the interaction axis between the two voices |
| M2 | **MOVEMENT** (AMPULLAE) | Sensitivity — velocity/aftertouch/expression depth |
| M3 | **COUPLING** (CARTILAGE) | Flexibility — filter resonance + envelope speed |
| M4 | **SPACE** (CURRENT) | Environment — chorus depth + delay + reverb |

**Key Parameters**
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|--------------|
| `ouie_v1Algorithm` | 0–7 | 0=VA, 4=PD | Voice 1 ("Left Eye") algorithm |
| `ouie_v2Algorithm` | 0–7 | 1=Wavetable | Voice 2 ("Right Eye") algorithm |
| `ouie_hammer` | -1–+1 | ±0.3–0.6 | STRIFE (<0) or LOVE (>0) interaction |
| `ouie_voiceMode` | 0–2 | 1=Layer | Split / Layer / Duo voice mode |
| `ouie_splitPoint` | C0–C8 | C4 | Split point for Split mode |
| `ouie_v1FilterCutoff` | 20–20k | 800–4k | Voice 1 SVF filter cutoff |
| `ouie_v2FilterCutoff` | 20–20k | 400–2k | Voice 2 SVF filter cutoff (often lower for contrast) |
| `ouie_lfo1Rate` | 0.01–10 Hz | 0.1–1.0 | LFO 1 rate (D005 floor: 0.01 Hz) |
| `ouie_lfo1Depth` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.4 | LFO 1 modulation depth |
| `ouie_ampAttack` | 0–10 s | 0.01–0.5 | Amp envelope attack |
| `ouie_ampRelease` | 0–20 s | 0.3–3.0 | Amp envelope release |

**The 8 Algorithms**
| Index | Name | Character |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 0 | VA | Virtual analog saw/square/tri with PWM — warm, familiar |
| 1 | Wavetable | 16 metallic/organic tables — morphable, textural |
| 2 | FM | 2-operator carrier+modulator — bell-like, percussive, inharmonic |
| 3 | Additive | 8 partials with individual amplitude — precise, spectral |
| 4 | Phase Dist | CZ-style phase distortion — nasal, sharp, hard |
| 5 | Wavefolder | Triangle multi-stage folding — aggressive, complex |
| 6 | KS | Karplus-Strong plucked string — organic, transient-rich |
| 7 | Noise | Filtered noise with pitch tracking — airy, unpitched |

**Coupling**
- **Sends:** L/R stereo audio; envelope level
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude opens filter), `LFOToPitch` (pitch drift), `AudioToFM` (FM modulation on voice 1), `AudioToRing` (ring modulation input)

**Recommended Pairings**
- **+ OPENSKY + OCEANDEEP:** OUIE at thermocline between them — the complete trilogy: abyss, surface, and the boundary between
- **+ OUROBOROS:** OUROBOROS chaos feeding OUIE's AudioToFM — the HAMMER axis becomes unstable in a musically productive way
- **+ OBBLIGATO:** Breath-driven voice above OUIE's duophonic texture — expressive lead over complex harmonic foundation
- **+ OBESE:** OBESE saturation on OUIE's output — STRIFE-side HAMMER particularly benefits from additional saturation

**Starter Recipes**
**Thermocline (LOVE):** V1=VA, V2=Wavetable, HAMMER=+0.6, Mode=Layer — constructive coupling blends the smooth and the textural; spectral richness from harmonic lock
**Strife Modulator:** V1=FM, V2=Wavefolder, HAMMER=-0.7, Mode=Layer — destructive cross-FM between an inharmonic and an aggressive voice; dissonant and alive
**Split Persona:** V1=VA (below C4), V2=KS (above C4), Mode=Split, HAMMER=0 — bass register warm and sustained; treble plucked and transient; one instrument, two characters
**Duo Hunting:** V1=Phase Dist, V2=Noise, Mode=Duo, HAMMER=-0.4 — the two most recent notes interact through ring modulation; each new note changes the texture of the one before it

**Designer Notes**
OUIE's central insight is that two voices don't need to agree. The HAMMER axis makes the relationship between them the instrument — not either voice in isolation. At LOVE extremes, the voices merge into something more coherent than either: harmonic lock adds intervals that weren't played, spectral blend creates a hybrid timbre. At STRIFE extremes, they fight: cross-FM introduces sidebands between them, ring modulation produces sum-and-difference frequencies that treat both voices as raw signal. The most musically interesting territory is moderate HAMMER values in either direction (±0.3–0.5), where the interaction is audible but not overwhelming. Voice mode shapes how the thermocline is played: Layer makes every note a two-voice interaction; Split gives you two entirely different instruments across the keyboard; Duo makes the most recent note always interact with the previous one — melodic lines that comment on themselves.

## 39. OWARE — The Resonant Board

**Gallery code:** OWARE | **Accent:** Akan Goldweight `#B5883E`
**Parameter prefix:** `owr_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The sunken oware board — a carved wooden mancala game from the Akan people of Ghana, lost to the Atlantic on a trade route and now encrusted with coral and bronze barnacles on the ocean floor. Strike a hollow and the whole board shimmers with sympathetic resonance.

### Identity
A tuned percussion synthesizer spanning the entire struck-idiophone family through continuous material morphing. OWARE covers African balafon, Javanese gamelan, Western vibraphone, Tibetan singing bowls, and bronze bells without switching modes — one continuous material continuum from wood to glass to metal to bowl. It is the oldest instrument in the aquarium: carved wood and spilled seeds meeting the sea floor.

### Signal Flow
Mallet Exciter (Chaigne contact model) → 8 Parallel Mode Resonators (material-ratio tuned) → Sympathetic Resonance Network (per-mode frequency coupling between voices) → Body Resonator (tube/frame/bowl/open) → Buzz Membrane (BPF + tanh for balafon mirliton) → Brightness Filter → Output. Thermal drift and per-voice shimmer LFO run continuously at all times, providing the alive quality even when no notes are playing.

### Macros
| Macro | Name | Mapping |
|-------|------|---------|
| M1 | **MATERIAL** | `owr_macroMaterial` — sweeps material continuum from wood toward metal/bowl |
| M2 | **MALLET** | `owr_macroMallet` — mallet hardness + brightness (soft mallets excite low modes only) |
| M3 | **COUPLING** | `owr_macroCoupling` — sympathetic resonance depth + coupling send level |
| M4 | **SPACE** | `owr_macroSpace` — body resonator depth + reverb send |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `owr_material` | 0–1 | 0.0–0.3 (wood), 0.33–0.66 (bell), 0.66–1.0 (metal/bowl) | Material continuum. Uses Rossing mode ratio tables: wood (inharmonic upper modes), bell (compact sub-harmonic cluster), metal (clean upper harmonics), bowl (very low partials). The most important single parameter. |
| `owr_malletHardness` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Mallet hardness. Soft (0) = long contact time, low-pass excitation, only low modes excited, plus a physical bounce. Hard (1) = short contact, bright excitation, all modes equally struck. Velocity amplifies this at every note-on. |
| `owr_bodyType` | 0–3 | 0=Tube, 1=Frame, 2=Bowl | Resonator body shape. Tube: cylindrical bore with delay-line resonance (marimba). Frame: three fixed-mode resonances at 200/580/1100 Hz (balafon wooden frame). Bowl: sub-octave modal resonance (gamelan, singing bowl). Open (3): no body coupling. |
| `owr_bodyDepth` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | How deeply the body couples with the mode resonators. Gaussian proximity boost: modes whose frequency is near a body resonance ring longer. |
| `owr_buzzAmount` | 0–1 | 0.0–0.3 | Buzz membrane (balafon mirliton). Extracts 200–800 Hz band, applies tanh nonlinearity, re-injects. Adds the characteristic buzzing rattle of a West African balafon. Off by default — add sparingly. |
| `owr_sympathyAmount` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Sympathetic resonance between voices. Frequency-selective: each mode in a new voice couples only to modes in other sounding voices that are close in frequency. Creates the shimmer of a gamelan when multiple notes are held. |
| `owr_shimmerRate` | 0–12 Hz | 5–8 Hz | Balinese beat-frequency shimmer rate in Hz. Shadow voice is detuned by exactly this Hz — not a ratio — creating the characteristic gamelan shimmer beat. 6 Hz is classic Balinese tuning. |
| `owr_thermalDrift` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.4 | Shared thermal tuning drift + per-voice personality offsets. The board warms up and cools down; each bar has a slightly different thermal character from manufacture. Makes the engine feel alive even during held notes. |
| `owr_brightness` | 200–20kHz | 4–12 kHz | High-frequency brightness ceiling. The material exponent alpha already controls per-mode decay differentiation (wood upper modes die fast, metal rings forever); brightness is the final air/warmth shaping. |
| `owr_damping` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.4 | Mode resonator Q factor reduction. Higher damping = shorter, more percussive sound. Lower = sustaining glass bowl character. |
| `owr_decay` | 0.05–10 s | 0.5–3.0 | Overall decay time envelope. Scales all mode resonator Q values simultaneously. This is the "room size" for the bar — how long the board remembers each impact. |
| `owr_filterEnvAmount` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.4 | Filter envelope depth. Velocity-triggered brightening on attack that decays — a velocity-to-brightness arc that follows every note. |

### Sound Design Tips
1. **Start with material, then add body.** `owr_material` at 0.0 (pure wood) gives marimba-like inharmonic tones. Dial up `owr_bodyType`=0 (tube) and `owr_bodyDepth` to 0.5 to add the cylindrical bore resonance — you are now building a marimba from scratch.
2. **Gamelan shimmer requires held notes and sympathy.** Set `owr_sympathyAmount` to 0.4+, `owr_shimmerRate` to 6 Hz, `owr_material` around 0.5 (bell range). Hold two or more notes for the characteristic beating shimmer to emerge between voices.
3. **The buzz membrane is a seasoning, not a main course.** `owr_buzzAmount` above 0.4 dominates; below 0.2 it adds authentic balafon texture. Try material=0.0, bodyType=1 (frame), buzz=0.15–0.2 for a close-miked West African balafon.
4. **Thermal drift is always on and always helping.** Even at low values (0.2–0.3), `owr_thermalDrift` prevents the engine from sounding mechanical. The shared drift makes all bars feel like they belong to the same physical instrument. Increase it for a beaten-up street instrument feel.
5. **Soft mallets and long decay make singing bowls.** material=1.0 (bowl), malletHardness=0.1–0.2, bodyType=2 (bowl), decay=6–10s, damping=0.05. The soft mallet excites only low modes; the bowl body couples the sub-octave resonance; the long decay lets everything ring. Rub the rim with a slow note-hold.

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Stereo audio (ch 0/1) — struck transients plus sustained sympathetic resonance field
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude opens brightness filter — great for sidechain effects), `LFOToPitch` (external pitch drift — adds detuning from another engine's LFO), `AmpToPitch` (env-to-pitch for subtle transient pitch effects), `EnvToMorph` (morphs material via coupling — allows another engine to change what OWARE is made of)
- **Best as source for:** `AmpToFilter` (transient strikes pumping other engines' filters in rhythm), `LFOToPitch` (slow shimmer drift as pitch source for melodic engines)
- **Ecosystem role:** The rhythmic-harmonic bridge between percussion and sustain. Sits between ONSET (pure percussion) and ODDOSCAR (pure sustain) — OWARE has both a transient and a long sustaining tail with harmonic content.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ ONSET:** The drum circle. ONSET's algorithmic drum voices beneath OWARE's harmonic bars — West African percussion ensemble, or a gamelan with a kit.
- **+ ODYSSEY:** Struck bar over open-water drift. OWARE's transient excites ODYSSEY's reverb tail — the mallet hit that becomes an ocean.
- **+ OPAL:** OWARE transients frozen into grain clouds by OPAL. A struck bar refracted into infinite shimmer particles.
- **+ ODDOSCAR:** OWARE for attack shape, ODDOSCAR for sustained body. Plucked-then-breathed. The struck note blooms into a pad.
- **+ OXBOW:** OWARE feeding OXBOW's FDN exciter — the struck bar becomes the impulse for an entangled resonance field. Both engines share a love of sympathetic resonance.

### Recommended Presets to Start With
- **Oware_Kelp_Garden** (Foundation) — classic marimba-range wood bars with body coupling, gentle sympathy shimmer
- **Oware_Brass_Bowls** (Atmosphere) — metal material, bowl body, long decay; Tibetan bowl character
- **Oware_Buzz_Ritual** (Flux) — buzz membrane active, frame body, fast decay; West African balafon at speed
- **Oware_Metal_Rain** (Flux) — metal material, high sympathy, shimmer active; a gamelan in a rainstorm
- **Oware_Gamelan_Still** (Atmosphere) — bell material, Balinese shimmer, long decay; the suspended chord that never resolves

## 40. OXBOW — Entangled Reverb

**Gallery code:** OXBOW | **Accent:** Oxbow Teal `#1A6B5A`
**Parameter prefix:** `oxb_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The Oxbow Eel at the twilight zone (200–1000m). An oxbow is a lake formed when a river cuts itself off — sound enters as rushing water, then the current is severed, leaving a suspended pool of resonance that slowly erases itself. What remains are golden standing waves.

### Identity
A reverb synthesis engine where the reverb is the instrument. OXBOW uses a Chiasmus FDN (8-channel Householder matrix with L/R delay times reversed — the same resonant structure in opposite temporal order) to create genuine structural entanglement between left and right. Every note becomes a pitched impulse that disappears into a resonance field that transforms as it decays. Oscar-dominant (0.3/0.7 feliX-Oscar polarity): mostly sustain, slow emergence.

### Signal Flow
MIDI Note → Pitched Exciter (sine + noise burst, velocity-scaled brightness) → Pre-Delay → 8-Channel Chiasmus FDN (Householder matrix, reversed L/R delay times, time-varying damping) → Phase Erosion (4 allpass filters per channel, L/R opposite-polarity LFOs) → Golden Resonance (Mid/Side convergence detection → 4 peak filters tuned to golden ratio harmonics of MIDI fundamental) → Dry/Wet Mix → Output.

### Macros
| Macro | Name | Mapping |
|-------|------|---------|
| M1 | **CHARACTER** | `oxb_entangle` — L/R cross-coupling amount; the depth of entanglement |
| M2 | **MOVEMENT** | `oxb_erosionRate` + `oxb_erosionDepth` — how fast and deep the phase erosion breathes |
| M3 | **COUPLING** | External coupling amount |
| M4 | **SPACE** | `oxb_decay` + `oxb_resonanceMix` — decay time + golden resonance blend |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `oxb_decay` | 0.1–60 s | 3–12 s | FDN decay time. Above 29s: feedback coefficient = 1.0 (Schulze infinite decay — reverb never dies). The single most dramatic parameter. |
| `oxb_entangle` | 0–1 | 0.4–0.7 | L/R cross-channel coupling in the FDN. At 0: L and R channels are independent (wide). At 1: fully blended (mono center). Sweet spot creates genuine stereo entanglement — neither stereo nor mono, but woven. Aftertouch pushes this higher in real-time. |
| `oxb_erosionRate` | 0.01–0.5 Hz | 0.05–0.15 | Rate of phase erosion LFOs. Four allpass stages per channel, L and R modulated with opposite polarity — spectral breathing that creates self-cancellation when summed to mono. This is the engine's primary autonomous modulation (D005 compliant). |
| `oxb_erosionDepth` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Depth of phase erosion modulation. Higher = more dramatic spectral sweeping as the reverb tail evolves. |
| `oxb_convergence` | 1–20 | 3–8 | Mid/Side energy ratio threshold for golden resonance trigger. When Mid >> Side (stereo channels converging), golden ratio peak filters ring out. Lower values = golden resonance activates more easily and often. |
| `oxb_resonanceMix` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Blend of golden ratio harmonic peaks into the output. The 4 peak filters are tuned to f, f×φ, f×φ², f×φ³ (weighted -3dB per φ multiple). They ring only when the FDN's L/R channels converge toward mono. |
| `oxb_resonanceQ` | 0.5–20 | 5–12 | Q factor of the golden ratio peak filters. Higher = narrower, more singing resonances. |
| `oxb_cantilever` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Asymmetric time-varying damping depth. Controls how dramatically damping increases as energy drops — bright early reflections become dark late reflections. This is what makes OXBOW transform as it decays. |
| `oxb_damping` | 200–16kHz | 4–10 kHz | Initial FDN damping frequency. High = bright reverb. Low = dark, submerged. The cantilever system then darkens from here as energy depletes. |
| `oxb_predelay` | 0–200 ms | 10–40 ms | Pre-delay before FDN input. Creates separation between dry transient and reverb wash. |
| `oxb_exciterDecay` | 0.001–0.1 s | 0.005–0.02 | Exciter decay time. Short = click/impulse character. Longer = pitched tone feeding the reverb. |
| `oxb_exciterBright` | 0–1 | 0.4–0.8 | Noise/sine ratio in exciter. 0 = pure pitched sine. 1 = pure noise burst. Velocity also scales brightness — harder hits are brighter excitations. |
| `oxb_dryWet` | 0–1 | 0.6–0.9 | Dry/wet balance (dry=exciter, wet=reverb). For most use, weight heavily toward wet — OXBOW is a reverb instrument. |

### Sound Design Tips
1. **Let it decay.** OXBOW's most interesting sounds happen after the attack. Set a long decay (8–20s), hold a note, then release and listen. The golden resonance emerges as the L/R channels converge — you will hear it shift from complex to singing to silence.
2. **Use aftertouch for entanglement control.** Aftertouch adds directly to `oxb_entangle` in real-time. Begin a note with wide stereo (low entangle), then press harder to pull the sound toward a coherent center — dramatic live performance technique.
3. **Infinite decay as a drone.** Set `oxb_decay` above 29s (the Schulze threshold). The FDN feedback becomes exactly 1.0. Hold a note and release: the reverb field never decays. Play a second note and the fields superimpose. OXBOW becomes a harmonic drone generator. Use the erosion LFOs to animate the drone.
4. **Convergence as a beat.** When `oxb_convergence` is set low (2–4) and `oxb_resonanceMix` is audible (0.4+), the golden resonance activates rhythmically each time the stereo image narrows. This creates an organic pulse tied to the reverb's internal dynamics — not tempo-synced, but musically related.
5. **Bright exciter, dark damping = maximum transformation.** Set `oxb_exciterBright` high, `oxb_damping` low (1–3 kHz), `oxb_cantilever` at 0.7+. The initial strike is noise-bright, but the reverb is immediately dark and the cantilever darkens it further as it decays. Maximum contrast between attack and tail.

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Stereo audio (ch 0/1) — the full reverb field including golden resonance
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude modulates FDN damping frequency — sidechain the reverb brightness), `EnvToDecay` (external envelope modulates decay time — shorten the reverb tail with transients), `AudioToRing` (ring-modulates the wet output with external audio)
- **Best as source for:** `AudioToBuffer` (reverb field as convolution source for granular engines), `AmpToFilter` (reverb envelope as slow filter pump)
- **Ecosystem role:** The entangled pool — OXBOW holds energy in suspension after other engines have moved on. Best positioned as the last processor in a chain.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OWARE:** Struck bar as FDN exciter. OWARE's transient feeds OXBOW's reverb field — the mallet hit becomes an entangled resonance pool. Both engines are physically modeled resonators.
- **+ ODDFELIX:** feliX's sharp snap as OXBOW exciter. The neon dart disappears into a suspended pool. Extreme contrast — the most percussive engine feeding the most sustained.
- **+ ODDOSCAR:** Two Oscar-dominant engines layered. OXBOW's entangled space beneath ODDOSCAR's breathing coral. The warmest, most still combination in the gallery.
- **+ OVERTONE:** Nautilus spectral partials feeding OXBOW's golden resonance detection. The irrational harmonics of OVERTONE converge with OXBOW's golden ratio filters — mathematical resonance stacking.
- **+ OUROBOROS:** Chaos injection. OUROBOROS's strange attractor feeding OXBOW's FDN exciter — the reverb field becomes chaotic, mutating, never repeating.

### Recommended Presets to Start With
- **Oxbow_Dried_Riverbed** (Flux) — medium decay, active erosion, moderate entanglement; the classic OXBOW texture
- **Oxbow_Scientist_Method** (Flux) — golden resonance prominent, convergence set low, long decay; mathematical shimmer
- **Oxbow_Still_Water** (Atmosphere) — infinite decay (29s+), low erosion, high entanglement; the pool that never drains
- **Oxbow_Entangled_Bloom** (Entangled) — coupled to OWARE or ODDFELIX; reverb field fed by transients
- **Oxbow_Golden_Toll** (Aether) — bright exciter, dark damping, cantilever high; bell tone that transforms completely into darkness

## 41. ORBWEAVE — Topological Knot Synthesis

**Gallery code:** ORBWEAVE | **Accent:** Kelp Knot Purple `#8E4585`
**Parameter prefix:** `weave_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The Kelp Knot — strands of giant kelp braided by current into topological formations on the ocean floor. Each knot type creates a different resonant character; each strand's phase is entangled with the others through a mathematical coupling matrix that cannot be undone.

### Identity
Phase-braided oscillator synthesis. Four oscillator strands whose phases influence each other's pitch through a configurable knot-topology coupling matrix. Different knot types (Trefoil, Figure-Eight, Torus, Solomon's Seal) produce different braid patterns — timbres that cannot be achieved with standard detuning because the coupling is structural, not just pitch offset. As braid depth increases, the four strands move from independent oscillators toward a single, knotted entity.

### Signal Flow
4 Strand Oscillators (shared waveform: Sine/Saw/Square/Triangle) → Knot Matrix Phase Coupling (4×4 matrix, L/R averaged to stereo, Torus P/Q dynamic modulation) → per-voice ADSR × 2 LFO slots × SVF Filter → 3 FX Slots (Delay/Chorus/Reverb, in series) → Pan → Output.

The knot coupling happens at the phase increment level: each sample, each strand reads the current phases of all other strands and adds a weighted phase-modulation amount. The matrix coefficients encode the topology — Trefoil has a 3-strand ring with one floating strand; Figure-Eight alternates over/under; Torus has dynamic P/Q winding numbers; Solomon's Seal has two doubly-linked rings.

### Macros
| Macro | Name | Mapping |
|-------|------|---------|
| M1 | **WEAVE** | `weave_macroWeave` — braid depth; how tightly the strands are coupled |
| M2 | **TENSION** | `weave_macroTension` — filter resonance boost + coupling feedback intensity |
| M3 | **KNOT** | `weave_macroKnot` — morphs between current knot type and the next in sequence |
| M4 | **SPACE** | `weave_macroSpace` — FX mix depth across all 3 FX slots |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `weave_knotType` | 0–3 | — | Knot topology: 0=Trefoil, 1=Figure-Eight, 2=Torus, 3=Solomon. Each produces a distinct timbral fingerprint from the same four oscillators. |
| `weave_braidDepth` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.7 | How much each strand's phase modulates the others. At 0: four independent oscillators (standard chord). At 1: fully braided (complex intermodulation). Sweet spot produces audible knot character without chaos. M1 WEAVE maps directly here. |
| `weave_torusP` | 1–8 | 2–4 | Torus knot P winding (only active with knotType=Torus). P wraps around the torus hole. Different P/Q ratios create different torus knot families (2,3=trefoil knot on torus, 3,5=cinquefoil, etc.). |
| `weave_torusQ` | 1–8 | 3–5 | Torus knot Q winding (only active with knotType=Torus). Q wraps through the hole. Integer ratios produce closed knots; non-integer ratios would produce open spirals. |
| `weave_strandType` | 0–4 | 1=Sine, 2=Saw | Waveform for all 4 strands. Sine: purest knot timbres. Saw: knot adds inharmonic sidebands. Square: maximum odd-harmonic content with knot modulation. |
| `weave_strandTune` | -24–+24 st | -12–+12 | Fine/coarse tuning offset between the strand pair spacing. Spreads the initial frequencies before knot coupling begins. |
| `weave_filterCutoff` | 20–20kHz | 400–6k | SVF filter cutoff. The four braided strands produce combination tones; filter shapes which frequencies dominate. |
| `weave_filterReso` | 0–1 | 0.0–0.4 | Filter resonance. M2 TENSION adds to this — useful for animating resonance via macro automation. |
| `weave_ampA/D/S/R` | varies | — | Standard ADSR. Longer attack with high braid depth produces a knot that slowly ties itself. |
| `weave_lfo1/2Rate` | 0.01–30 Hz | 0.1–2 Hz | LFO rate. Target=BraidDepth makes the knot tighten and loosen rhythmically. Target=FilterCutoff creates standard filter wobble. |

### Sound Design Tips
1. **Start with Trefoil, increase braid depth gradually.** Trefoil is the most immediately musical knot — a three-strand ring with one floating overtone. Begin with braidDepth=0 (clean chord), bring it to 0.4–0.6, and listen to the new combination tones emerge that aren't present in any single strand.
2. **Figure-Eight for rhythmic pulse.** The alternating over/under pattern of Figure-Eight creates natural amplitude beating between strands. Set braidDepth=0.5–0.7 with sine oscillators and a slow LFO targeting BraidDepth — you get rhythmic pulsing without any tempo sync.
3. **Torus P/Q for pitched inharmonicity.** knotType=Torus with P=2, Q=3 is the trefoil-on-torus (musical, stable); P=3, Q=5 is cinquefoil (more complex); P=3, Q=7 pushes toward chaos. Higher Q values produce combination tones that create apparent new pitches.
4. **Solomon for two-voice counterpoint.** knotType=Solomon has two coupled ring pairs. With low braidDepth (0.2–0.3), it sounds like two independent instruments sharing a room. With higher depth, the rings start to interfere and produce cross-ring modulation. Useful for duophonic patches.
5. **M3 KNOT morphing as performance.** Assign KNOT macro to a mod wheel or expression pedal. As you sweep from 0 to 1, the coupling matrix blends from the current knot type toward the next. This is a real-time timbral morph that no standard filter or detuning can produce — the actual topological structure of the sound is changing.

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Stereo audio (ch 0/1), last rendered L/R sample
- **Receives:** `AudioToFM` (external audio shifts all strand pitches — feeding ORBWEAVE's strands with another engine's audio creates cross-knot modulation), `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude opens SVF filter), `LFOToPitch` (external pitch drift on all strands), `AmpToChoke` (note-off all active voices)
- **Best as source for:** `AudioToFM` (ORBWEAVE's knotted audio as FM source into other engines — very unusual harmonic sidebands), `AmpToFilter` (smooth envelope as filter control source)
- **Ecosystem role:** The topological undercurrent — complex harmonic content that cannot be analyzed as simple intervals. Best combined with engines that have clear harmonic structure (OVERTONE, ODDOSCAR) to create contrast between rational and irrational spectra.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OVERTONE:** Rational (CF convergent) spectral structure vs. topological phase-braid structure. The Nautilus and the Kelp Knot. Mathematical cousins with entirely different timbral languages.
- **+ OVERLAP:** Both engines work with topological coupling concepts (KnotTopology coupling type). OVERLAP's FDN + ORBWEAVE's phase-braid creates entangled resonance fields.
- **+ ODDOSCAR:** Oscar's Perlin-breathing pad beneath ORBWEAVE's structural knot tone. Organic drift + structural complexity.
- **+ OSTINATO:** Rhythmic fire drum beneath knotted spectral content. OSTINATO's transients trigger ORBWEAVE's envelope via AmpToChoke coupling — a percussive gate on the knot.
- **+ OBLONG:** Two texture-forward engines layered. Bob's curious inquisitive texture and ORBWEAVE's knotted inharmonicity are both "strange but harmonic" — they occupy similar sonic territory from different angles.

### Recommended Presets to Start With
- **Orbweave_Kelp_Garden** (Foundation) — Trefoil, moderate braid depth, slow SPACE LFO; foundational knotted pad
- **Orbweave_Knot_Theory** (Foundation) — all four knot types explored via KNOT macro sweep preset
- **Orbweave_Figure_Eight_Bass** (Foundation) — Figure-Eight with saw oscillators, low filter cutoff; knotted bass
- **Orbweave_Torus_Embrace** (Atmosphere) — Torus P=2 Q=3, long attack, high reverb; shimmering torus knot pad
- **Orbweave_Trefoil_Tangle** (Entangled) — Trefoil at high braid depth coupled to ODDOSCAR; knotted texture over breathing coral

## 42. OVERTONE — Spectral Additive via Continued Fractions

**Gallery code:** OVERTONE | **Accent:** Spectral Ice `#A8D8EA`
**Parameter prefix:** `over_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The Nautilus — mid-column dweller (200–1000m mesopelagic zone). The nautilus shell grows according to a logarithmic spiral: each new chamber is a rational approximation to an irrational proportion. OVERTONE embodies this exactly — 8 additive partials tuned not to integer harmonics but to the continued fraction convergents of π, e, φ, and √2. As depth increases, partials spiral outward from clean integer ratios toward the irrational ideal.

### Identity
A spectral additive synthesizer where partial frequencies are derived from the continued fraction convergents of mathematical constants. At low depth, the partials are near-integer and the sound is almost harmonic. As depth increases, partials drift toward irrational spacing — metallic, shimmering inharmonicity that no equal-tempered instrument can produce. The engine is monophonic but meditatively deep, perfectly suited to long sustained tones where the spectral evolution becomes the music.

### Signal Flow
8 Phase-Accumulator Sine Oscillators (CF-ratio tuned, harmonic-series amplitude weighting 1/(n+1)) → Global ADSR Amp Envelope (velocity-scaled) → 2 LFOs (LFO1→depth sweep, LFO2→partial phase rotation) → Allpass Resonator (tuned to fundamental, optional comb effect) → 2-pole Butterworth High-Cut Filter (brightness shaping) → Schroeder Reverb (4 combs + 2 allpass, prime-spaced, bright spectral character) → Output.

### Macros
| Macro | Name | Mapping |
|-------|------|---------|
| M1 | **DEPTH** | `over_macroDepth` — convergent index sweep (clean integer → irrational/metallic) |
| M2 | **COLOR** | `over_macroColor` — partial brightness: boost upper vs lower partials |
| M3 | **COUPLING** | `over_macroCoupling` — cross-engine coupling send amount |
| M4 | **SPACE** | `over_macroSpace` — resonator + reverb mix |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `over_constant` | 0–3 | 2=Phi | Mathematical constant for partial ratios. 0=Pi (widely spaced, inharmonic), 1=E (clustered near 1.3–1.5×, unusual resonance), 2=Phi/Fibonacci (most musical — converges naturally), 3=Sqrt2 (closely clustered near √2, narrow metallic shimmer). |
| `over_depth` | 0–7 | 1–4 | Convergent depth index. Selects which convergent in the table becomes the starting partial. At depth=0, partial 0 is at 1.0× fundamental (clean). As depth increases, partials move to higher convergents — deeper into the irrational. LFO1 sweeps this for animated spectral evolution. |
| `over_partial0–7` | 0–1 | default 1/(n+1) | Individual partial amplitude weights. Default is harmonic series falloff. Sculpt these to emphasize specific partials — boost partial 3 alone for a strange upper-partial tone, mute lower partials for whistling high texture. |
| `over_velBright` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.5 | Velocity-to-brightness (D001). Harder velocity = brighter cutoff on the high-cut filter. Gentler notes sound darker and warmer. |
| `over_filterCutoff` | 1–20kHz | 6–16kHz | Brightness high-cut filter. OVERTONE is bright by nature (spectral ice); this is the ceiling. Lower for warmer, more submerged spectral character. |
| `over_ampAtk/Dec/Sus/Rel` | varies | atk 0.02, rel 1–3s | Amp envelope. Long attacks let the irrational partials slowly bloom into full spectral complexity. Long releases let the Schroeder reverb develop crystalline tails. |
| `over_lfo1Rate` | 0.01–10 Hz | 0.1–0.5 | LFO1 rate (targets depth). Slow sweep of the convergent depth makes the spectrum slowly spiral outward and back — the nautilus shell growing. |
| `over_lfo1Depth` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.4 | LFO1 depth (depth sweep amount). How far the convergent index moves per LFO cycle. |
| `over_lfo2Rate` | 0.01–10 Hz | 0.05–0.2 | LFO2 rate (targets partial phase rotation). Each partial advances its phase by the LFO amount, creating a slow kaleidoscopic phase shimmer. |
| `over_resoMix` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.3 | Allpass resonator mix. Adds a comb-filter coloration tuned to the MIDI fundamental — reinforces the spectral identity. |

### Sound Design Tips
1. **Phi (constant=2) is your home base.** The Fibonacci convergents are the most musical because they are maximally irrational (slowest-converging) — every depth level sounds different but nothing is atonal. Start with Phi, explore depth=1–3 for familiar territory.
2. **Pi (constant=0) for metallic inharmonicity.** Pi convergents include 22/7 and 355/113 — well-known approximations that create wide, unusual partial spacing. Great for bell and metal timbres. Combine with long decay and high resonator mix.
3. **LFO1 depth sweep is the engine's signature.** Slowly sweeping the convergent depth with LFO1 at 0.1–0.3 Hz creates the nautilus spiral effect — partials gradually rotating through irrational positions and returning. This is what makes OVERTONE unlike any other additive synth.
4. **Sculpt the partial amplitude profile for character.** Mute partials 0–2 (set to 0) and boost partials 5–7 for a high spectral shimmer with no fundamental. Add bass by boosting partial 0 and setting upper partials low — an almost sine-wave tone with irrational overtone dust.
5. **SPACE macro for reverb depth as performance control.** With high SPACE values, the Schroeder reverb builds up over held notes. Pull SPACE down between phrases to clear the reverb field and start fresh — creates natural phrasing structure from a macro gesture.

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Monophonic stereo audio (ch 0/1)
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude modulates brightness filter cutoff), `LFOToPitch` (external pitch drift shifts all 8 partial frequencies proportionally — maintains their ratios), `AudioToFM` (external audio adds to the depth parameter as FM — modulates the convergent index in real-time)
- **Best as source for:** `AudioToFM` (OVERTONE's spectral audio used as FM source in other engines — unusual harmonic injection), `AmpToFilter` (smooth spectral envelope driving external filters)
- **Ecosystem role:** The mathematical shimmer voice — pitched but not harmonic, sustained but not static. Occupies a unique niche between tonal pads and metallic sound effects.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ ORBWEAVE:** Mathematical resonance meeting topological phase-braiding. OVERTONE's CF partials and ORBWEAVE's knot matrices both operate through mathematical structure — together they produce spectral complexity that goes far beyond standard synthesis.
- **+ OXBOW:** OVERTONE spectral partials feed OXBOW's golden resonance detection. When OVERTONE's phi-ratio partials converge with OXBOW's φ-tuned peak filters, resonant harmonic alignment produces unexpected singing tones.
- **+ ODDOSCAR:** Sustained spectral shimmer over coral breathing. OVERTONE's mesopelagic ice above ODDOSCAR's warm coral pad — the cold and the warm meeting.
- **+ OPAL:** OVERTONE's partials granularized by OPAL. Irrational partials scattered into grain clouds — the nautilus shell dissolved into particles.
- **+ ORACLE:** Two mathematically-grounded engines: ORACLE's GENDY stochastic synthesis and OVERTONE's continued fraction partials. Mathematical depth meeting mathematical randomness.

### Recommended Presets to Start With
- **Overtone_Nautilus_Glide** (Flux) — Phi constant, LFO1 sweeping depth slowly; the spiraling nautilus tone
- **Overtone_Crystal_Rain** (Flux) — Pi constant, high upper partials, short attack; metallic inharmonic bell cascade
- **Overtone_Depth_Wander** (Flux) — depth LFO at 0.2 Hz, moderate reverb; slow spectral evolution
- **Overtone_Euler_Flux** (Flux) — E constant, clustered partials; unusual narrowband shimmer
- **Overtone_Ratio_Sweep** (Flux) — DEPTH macro automation sweep across all convergents; full engine demonstration

## 43. ORGANISM — Cellular Automata Synthesis

**Gallery code:** ORGANISM | **Accent:** Emergence Lime `#C6E377`
**Parameter prefix:** `org_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The Coral Colony — millions of polyps following simple local rules, producing emergent architecture that no single polyp could plan. ORGANISM lives in the mid-water column, neither feliX nor Oscar — it is the engine of emergence itself. Simple rules at the cellular level become complex, unpredictable, living sound.

### Identity
A generative synthesizer driven by a 16-cell 1D elementary cellular automaton (Wolfram rules 0–255). Every N samples, the automaton advances one generation according to the selected rule. The 16-bit cell state maps to four synthesis dimensions simultaneously: cells 0–3 control filter cutoff, cells 4–7 control envelope rate, cells 8–11 control pitch offset (±6 semitones from root), cells 12–15 control reverb send. The result is a synth that generates its own rhythmic and harmonic content from mathematics — alive without randomness, deterministic without being predictable.

### Signal Flow
MIDI Note (sets root pitch) → Cellular Automaton (16-cell, 256 rules, circular wrap) → CA Output Mapping (cells → filter/amp/pitch/FX) → PolyBLEP Anti-Aliased Oscillator (saw/square/tri) + Sub Oscillator (one octave below, square) → ADSR Amp Envelope (CA-rate modulated) → 2-Pole LP Filter (CA-cutoff modulated) → 2 LFOs (LFO1→step rate, LFO2→filter offset) → Allpass Diffusion Reverb → Output.

### Macros
| Macro | Name | Mapping |
|-------|------|---------|
| M1 | **RULE** | `org_macroRule` — sweeps through 8 curated interesting rules (30, 90, 110, 184, 150, 18, 54, 22) |
| M2 | **SEED** | `org_macroSeed` — randomizes initial 16-bit cell state (new timbral/rhythmic variety from same rule) |
| M3 | **COUPLING** | `org_macroCoupling` — cross-engine coupling send amount |
| M4 | **MUTATE** | `org_macroMutate` — random bit-flip mutation rate per step (0=deterministic, 1=full chaos) |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `org_rule` | 0–255 | 30, 90, 110, 184 | Wolfram elementary CA rule. Rule 110 (Turing-complete) and Rule 90 (Sierpinski triangle) are the most musically interesting. Rule 30 is chaotic (good for noise/texture). Rule 184 is traffic-flow (rhythmic, regular). The M1 RULE macro sweeps 8 curated rules without exposing the full 256. |
| `org_seed` | 0–65535 | 42 (default) | Initial 16-bit cell state. Changing this with the same rule produces an entirely different melodic-rhythmic pattern — the same automaton logic, different data. M2 SEED randomizes this. |
| `org_stepRate` | 0.5–32 Hz | 2–8 Hz | How many CA generations per second. At 4 Hz: each cell evolution takes 250ms (quarter-note at 60 BPM). At 16 Hz: very fast cellular evolution, quasi-continuous modulation. At 0.5 Hz: slow architectural shifts. |
| `org_scope` | 1–16 | 4–8 | Moving average window over the last N generations. Scope=1: raw CA output (maximum change per step). Scope=8: smoothed CA output (slower filter sweeps, gentler pitch changes). High scope = smooth; low scope = glitchy. |
| `org_mutate` | 0–1 | 0–0.1 | Random bit-flip rate per generation. At 0: deterministic (same rule+seed always produces same pattern). At 0.01: occasional random mutations keep the automaton from settling into fixed points. At 0.5: near-random chaos. M4 MUTATE maps here. |
| `org_freeze` | bool | off | Freeze the CA state — cell evolution stops, current mapping values are held. Use to lock in an interesting filter/pitch/envelope state for performance, then unfreeze to continue evolution. |
| `org_oscWave` | 0–2 | 0=saw | Oscillator waveform: 0=saw, 1=square, 2=triangle. The CA's pitch modulation applies to whatever wave is selected. Saw has maximum harmonic content to interact with the CA filter sweeps. |
| `org_subLevel` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Sub oscillator level (one octave below, square wave). Adds bass foundation to the melodic CA output. Particularly useful when CA pitch sweeps go high — the sub anchors the sound. |
| `org_filterCutoff` | 200–8kHz | 1–4 kHz | Base filter cutoff. CA cells 0–3 modulate this around the base value. Setting the base higher gives the CA more positive sweep room; lower gives it a darker starting point. |
| `org_velCutoff` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Velocity-to-cutoff amount (D001). Harder velocity = brighter initial filter state — the CA then evolves from a brighter starting point. |
| `org_lfo1Rate` | 0.01–10 Hz | 0.1–1 Hz | LFO1 rate (targets CA step rate). Slowly modulating the step rate creates rhythmic acceleration/deceleration of the cellular evolution — the colony's metabolism changing. |
| `org_reverbMix` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.4 | Allpass diffusion reverb mix. CA cells 12–15 also modulate this — the colony controls its own reverb depth. |

### Sound Design Tips
1. **Learn the curated rules before exploring the full 256.** Use M1 RULE macro to sweep through Rules 30, 90, 110, 184, 150, 18, 54, 22. Each has a distinct character: Rule 110 is structured and repetitive with occasional complex bursts; Rule 90 is fractal and symmetric; Rule 30 is irregular and chaotic; Rule 184 has a periodic, traffic-like flow. Choose based on the musical context.
2. **Seed is your melodic library.** With a fixed rule, sweeping M2 SEED through different values produces an entire library of melodies and rhythmic patterns — all derived from the same automaton logic, all deterministic and reproducible. Record seeds of patterns you like.
3. **Scope is the smoothness dial.** Low scope (1–2) gives raw CA output: abrupt filter jumps, sudden pitch changes, glitchy. High scope (8–16) gives averaged output: slow filter sweeps, gradual pitch evolution, meditative. Scope is the bridge between glitch and ambient.
4. **Mutate at low values for living drift.** A mutation rate of 0.01–0.03 occasionally flips a bit, preventing the CA from settling into a fixed point or short cycle. The result sounds like an organic system — mostly deterministic, occasionally surprising. This is the "the colony has a mutation" effect.
5. **Use freeze as a performance tool.** During a performance, identify a moment where the CA produces an interesting filter/pitch state. Activate `org_freeze` — the evolution stops, but the current modulation values are held. Play melodically over the frozen state, then release freeze to resume evolution. Extremely powerful for live sets.

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Monophonic audio (ch 0/1) — the CA-evolved synthesis output
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude additionally modulates filter cutoff — sidechain the CA filter with a percussion engine), `LFOToPitch` (external pitch drift offsets ORGANISM's CA-generated pitch), `AudioToFM` (external audio modulates step rate as a clock source — another engine drives the CA's evolution speed)
- **Best as source for:** `AmpToFilter` (CA filter envelope as modulation source — generative filter modulation for other engines), `LFOToPitch` (CA pitch output as melodic suggestion for pitched engines)
- **Ecosystem role:** The generative heart — ORGANISM generates its own melody, rhythm, timbre, and reverb from a single mathematical rule. It needs no external modulation to produce music; coupling enhances rather than drives it.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ ONSET:** ONSET's drum triggers feed ORGANISM via `AmpToFilter` coupling — the drum pattern modulates the CA's filter cutoff, creating rhythmically synchronized generative melody.
- **+ ODDFELIX:** feliX's sharp transient triggers ORGANISM's amp envelope via `AmpToChoke` — each dart briefly silences and restarts the colony. Percussive gates on generative texture.
- **+ OPAL:** ORGANISM's cellular audio frozen into grain clouds. The CA-generated melody becomes source material for granular resampling — deterministic music becoming granular texture.
- **+ OUROBOROS:** Two generative systems coupled. OUROBOROS's strange attractor feeds ORGANISM's pitch via `LFOToPitch`. Mathematical chaos and mathematical determinism in conversation.
- **+ ODDOSCAR:** CA-generated melodic motion over Oscar's sustaining coral pad. The colony plays melody; the reef provides harmony. Classic textural pairing.

### Recommended Presets to Start With
- **Organism_Reef_Colony** (Organic/Submerged) — Rule 110, scope=6, medium step rate; structured colony evolution
- **Organism_Breathing_Colony** (Atmosphere) — Rule 90, high scope, slow step rate; meditative fractal breathing
- **Organism_Fractal_Bloom** (Atmosphere) — Rule 90 (Sierpinski), slow scope evolution; fractal harmonic cascade
- **Organism_Glitch_Colony** (Flux) — Rule 30, scope=1, fast step rate; chaotic rapid-fire CA glitch texture
- **Organism_Mutation_Drift** (Flux) — any rule with mutate=0.03; slowly mutating deterministic pattern

## 44. OBRIX — Modular Brick Synthesis

**Gallery code:** OBRIX | **Accent:** Reef Jade `#1E8B7E`
**Parameter prefix:** `obrix_`
**Aquatic mythology:** The Coral Reef — billions of individual polyps (bricks) building complex three-dimensional structure through simple local chemistry. OBRIX sits in the shallow productive zone (0–50m): where light, nutrients, and competition create the most complex ecosystems. Every brick is an independent sound source; the reef is their aggregate.

### Identity
A modular synthesis engine built from discrete "bricks" — independent oscillator/filter/amplifier units that can be combined, competed, and coupled. OBRIX has 79 parameters organized into five DSP layers: core brick synthesis, Harmonic Field (just intonation attraction/repulsion), Environmental parameters (temperature/pressure/current/turbidity), Brick Ecology (competition/symbiosis between bricks), and Stateful Synthesis (cumulative stress/bleaching history). No other XOmnibus engine models the *history* of notes played — OBRIX has memory.

### Signal Flow
MIDI Note → Voice Allocation (8 voices, brick mode) → Source 1 + Source 2 (independent oscillator units: saw/square/tri/noise/sine/FM) → Harmonic Field (per-voice JI attractor/repulsor: 3-limit/5-limit/7-limit ratio tables, IIR convergence) → Brick Ecology (competition: cross-amplitude suppression; symbiosis: noise→FM cross-coupling) → Filter Envelope (velocity-scaled D001 path, stress/bleach offset) → State Layer (stress accumulator +900Hz, bleach accumulator -700Hz — both persist across notes) → FX Chain (serial or parallel: AquaticFX + MathFX + BoutiqueFX slots) → Output.

### Macros
| Macro | Name | Mapping |
|-------|------|---------|
| M1 | **CHARACTER** | `obrix_macroBrightness` — sweeps filter cutoff + harmonic field strength simultaneously |
| M2 | **MOVEMENT** | `obrix_macroLFO` — LFO rate + depth across both source oscillators |
| M3 | **COUPLING** | Cross-engine coupling send amount |
| M4 | **ECOLOGY** | `obrix_macroEcology` — competition + symbiosis strengths simultaneously |

### Key Parameters — Core
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `obrix_src1Type` | 0–5 | 0–2 | Source 1 waveform: 0=saw, 1=square, 2=tri, 3=noise, 4=sine, 5=FM. FM (5) enables the symbiosis ecology (noise in src1 modulates FM depth in src2). |
| `obrix_src2Type` | 0–5 | 1–4 | Source 2 waveform. Running different types on src1/src2 creates brick-level timbral layering. |
| `obrix_src1Level` | 0–1 | 0.5–0.8 | Source 1 volume. The competition ecology scales this down when src2 amplitude is high. |
| `obrix_src2Level` | 0–1 | 0.4–0.7 | Source 2 volume. Start lower than src1; competition ecology will balance dynamically. |
| `obrix_filterCutoff` | 80–18kHz | 600–4000 Hz | Filter cutoff before all modulations. Velocity, stress, bleach, current, and LFOs all offset this. With 5 independent modulation sources, cutoff is rarely static. |
| `obrix_filterRes` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.6 | Filter resonance. The stress accumulator raises cutoff; high resonance at high stress creates self-filtering squeals. |

### Key Parameters — Harmonic Field (Wave 4)
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `obrix_fieldStrength` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | IIR convergence rate toward the nearest just-ratio. 0 = equal temperament (no attraction). 0.5 = strong pull toward JI. The field slowly bends pitch toward consonance or dissonance depending on polarity. |
| `obrix_fieldPolarity` | -1 to 1 | ±0.3–0.8 | +1 = attractor (voices converge toward just ratios — warm, pure). -1 = repulsor (voices pushed away from just ratios — dissonant, beating). 0 = no field. This single parameter transforms the engine from consonant to chaotic. |
| `obrix_fieldRate` | 0.01–10 Hz | 0.05–0.5 | How fast the IIR field convergence updates. Slow rates create gentle pitch drift. Fast rates create audible vibrato-like warping toward/away from JI. |
| `obrix_fieldPrimeLimit` | 3/5/7 | 5 | Prime limit of the just intonation system: 3-limit (perfect 5ths only), 5-limit (major/minor thirds), 7-limit (include septimal ratios). Higher = richer harmonic gravity field. |

### Key Parameters — Environmental (Wave 4)
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `obrix_envTemp` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.5 | Water temperature. Scales thermal drift depth — high temperature = more organic pitch instability. |
| `obrix_envPressure` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | Depth pressure. Scales LFO rate — higher pressure = faster internal modulation (the reef's metabolism). |
| `obrix_envCurrent` | -1 to 1 | ±0.2–0.5 | Water current direction and speed. Biases filter cutoff ±2000Hz. Positive = warm current brightening. Negative = cold current darkening. Automates slowly for tidal shift effect. |
| `obrix_envTurbidity` | 0–1 | 0–0.15 | Particulate matter in water. Adds engine-level noise per sample — a granular texture above the synthesis. Above 0.2 becomes a cloud; above 0.5 dominates. |

### Key Parameters — Ecology (Wave 4)
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `obrix_competitionStrength` | 0–1 | 0.2–0.5 | Cross-amplitude suppression between src1 and src2. When src2 is loud, src1 is attenuated (and vice versa). Creates natural timbral alternation — bricks competing for spectral space. Floor at 0.1 (neither source can be fully silenced by the other). |
| `obrix_symbiosisStrength` | 0–1 | 0.3–0.6 | When src1Type=noise (3), src1 amplitude drives FM depth on src2. The two sources become mutually dependent — noise fuels FM. More symbiosis = noisier FM = richer but less pitched timbre. Requires src1Type=5 on src2 to activate. |

### Key Parameters — State (Wave 4)
| Parameter | Range | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| `obrix_stressDecay` | 0.001–0.1 | 0.005–0.02 | How fast the stress accumulator decays between notes. Fast = stress dissipates quickly. Slow = each note adds more stress, gradually brightening the filter. Playing rapid passages pushes stress to max (+900Hz cutoff boost). |
| `obrix_bleachRate` | 0–1 | 0.1–0.3 | Rate at which high notes (above C5) accumulate bleach. Bleach simulates coral bleaching — sustained high-note playing lowers the filter ceiling (-700Hz over time). The engine literally changes as you play it. |
| `obrix_stateReset` | bool | off | Clears both stress and bleach accumulators. Essential between takes. |
| `obrix_fxMode` | 0–1 | 0 | 0=Serial FX (each slot processes previous output — traditional chain). 1=Parallel FX (each slot processes dry signal independently, wet contributions summed — dramatically different FX interaction). |

### Sound Design Tips
1. **Start with fieldPolarity = 0, then move it.** Begin with no harmonic field. As you add polarity (positive or negative), the engine transforms from a standard subtractive synth into a JI-attractor or dissonance-repulsor. The shift is gradual and musical — this is the engine's primary personality control.
2. **Competition creates organic timbral rhythm.** Set src1=saw, src2=square, competitionStrength=0.4. As you play chords, the two sources naturally alternate prominence based on their amplitude dynamics. The result sounds like two players competing for a microphone — neither fully wins.
3. **Stress as an arc.** Set `obrix_stressDecay` slow (0.002). Play ascending lines. The filter gradually brightens with each note (+900Hz per strong velocity hit). After 8–10 notes, the engine is wide open. This models a performance arc — the reef "heating up" as the musician plays harder.
4. **Parallel FX for dense textures.** Switch `obrix_fxMode` to 1. Each FX slot now processes the dry signal independently — AquaticFX, MathFX, and BoutiqueFX blend together rather than chaining. The result is denser, less coherent, more "reef ecosystem" than "signal chain."
5. **Turbidity as glue.** Set `obrix_envTurbidity` to 0.05–0.1. This adds a constant particulate noise floor that makes OBRIX sit in a mix like a room microphone — every note has a living space around it. Use sparingly.
6. **7-limit field for jazz.** Set `obrix_fieldPrimeLimit` to 7 and `obrix_fieldPolarity` to +0.6. The harmonic field pulls toward septimal ratios — the engine gravitates toward the ♭7 and augmented 5th as natural consonances. Unusual and compelling for jazz or modal contexts.

### Coupling
- **Sends:** Stereo audio (ch 0/1), plus state signals (stress level, bleach level available as modulation sources)
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (external amplitude modulates cutoff — sidechain OBRIX with a kick to pump the reef), `EnvToLFO` (external envelope modulates LFO rate — sync reef metabolism to another engine's timing), `AudioToFM` (external audio feeds src2 FM depth — another engine's timbre drives OBRIX's internal FM synthesis)
- **Best as source for:** `AmpToFilter` (stress accumulator as slow rising filter pump), `LFOToPitch` (competition dynamics as pitch modulation)
- **Ecosystem role:** The layered reef — OBRIX provides the most complex DSP environment in the fleet. Best used as a primary voice with other engines providing motion, percussion, or atmospheric layering.

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ ONSET:** ONSET's drum transients feed OBRIX's stress accumulator via `AmpToFilter` — drum hits brighten the reef filter in real time. The reef responds to percussion.
- **+ ORGANISM:** CA generative melody over OBRIX's stateful harmonic field. ORGANISM provides evolving pitch; OBRIX provides the timbral environment that changes with the history of notes played.
- **+ OXBOW:** OBRIX's complex brick synthesis feeding OXBOW's Chiasmus FDN reverb. The reef dissolves into an entangled reverb pool — complexity becoming suspension.
- **+ OWARE:** Two physically-aware engines. OWARE's mallet physics feeds OBRIX's FM via `AudioToFM`. Struck bars driving FM bricks.
- **+ OUROBOROS:** OUROBOROS's strange attractor drives OBRIX's harmonic field rate via `EnvToLFO`. Mathematical chaos controls how fast the reef's JI attractor updates — fast attractor motion sounds like pitch vibrato; slow motion sounds like tidal tuning shift.

### Recommended Presets to Start With
- **Obrix_Reef_Init** (Foundation) — default patch: all 5 systems at conservative settings, fieldPolarity neutral; learn the core brick character before engaging ecology
- **Obrix_JI_Attractor** (Foundation) — fieldPolarity +0.8, 5-limit, slow fieldRate; gentle convergence toward just intonation on every note
- **Obrix_Competition_Bass** (Foundation) — src1=saw, src2=square, high competition; fat competitive bass with natural timbral alternation
- **Obrix_Bleaching_Lead** (Flux) — stressDecay slow, bleachRate high; lead that gradually darkens as you play higher — the performance arc
- **Obrix_Turbid_Texture** (Atmosphere) — turbidity 0.08, parallel FX, low current; immersive particulate ambient texture
- **Obrix_Symbiosis_Cloud** (Atmosphere) — src1=noise, src2=FM, symbiosis 0.6; noise-fueled FM cloud with ecology-driven timbral animation
- **Obrix_Septimal_Chord** (Entangled) — 7-limit field, fieldPolarity +0.7, moderate strength; chords that pull toward septimal consonances
- **Obrix_Repulsor_Swarm** (Flux) — fieldPolarity -0.9, 5-limit, fast fieldRate; active JI repulsion creates beating, dissonant energy
- **Obrix_Stressed_Peak** (Prism) — stressDecay 0.002, high velocity sensitivity; filter opens progressively with playing intensity
- **Obrix_Parallel_Wall** (Aether) — fxMode=parallel, all three FX chains active; maximum FX density from independent processing

## 46. OFFERING (XOffering)
*Psychology-driven boom bap drum synthesis — the Mantis Shrimp*

**Accent:** Crate Wax Yellow `#E5B80B` | **Prefix:** `ofr_` | **Voices:** 8 (one per drum slot)
**Creature:** The Mantis Shrimp — hyper-perceptive crustacean seeing timbral dimensions other engines cannot
**Polarity:** 65% feliX / 35% Oscar — surface-weighted but with deep undertow
**Depth:** Rubble Zone (5–15m)

### What It Does
The first dedicated boom bap drum synthesis engine in the fleet. OFFERING doesn't play back samples — it *synthesizes* the entire crate-digging process. Each of 8 voices has a distinct drum topology (kick ≠ snare ≠ hat, architecturally), processed through a 4-stage signal chain: **Transient Generator** → **Texture Layer** (vinyl/tape/bit/wobble) → **Collage Engine** (layer/chop/stretch/ring mod) → **City Processing Chain** (5 psychoacoustic archetypes). The Curiosity Engine, driven by published psychology research (Berlyne 1960, Wundt 1874, Csikszentmihalyi 1975), introduces controlled timbral variation on each trigger — the drums evolve as you play them.

**Detroit Drunk Timing** applies per-voice trigger delay (±15ms) when Detroit city mode is active — Dilla's legacy in DSP.

MIDI note mapping follows GM drum positions: C2=Kick, D2=Snare, F#2=CHat, A#2=OHat, D#2=Clap, C#2=Rim, A2=Tom, C#3=Perc.

### Macros
| Macro | Name | Mapping | What It Controls |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **DIG** | `ofr_macroDig` → curiosity + complexity + flow | How deep into the crate — familiar vs. alien drum character |
| M2 | **CITY** | `ofr_macroCity` → cityMode + cityIntensity + cityBlend | Geographic psychoacoustic character — NY/Detroit/LA/Toronto/Bay Area |
| M3 | **FLIP** | `ofr_macroFlip` → flipLayers + flipChop + flipStretch + flipRingMod | Collage intensity — single hit to fractured assemblage |
| M4 | **DUST** | `ofr_macroDust` → dustVinyl + dustTape + dustBits + dustWobble | Patina and degradation — pristine to buried-in-a-crate |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Default | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `ofr_transientSnap` | 0–1 | 0.5 | 0.3–0.7 | Transient sharpness across all drum types. Higher = crispier attacks. |
| `ofr_transientPitch` | 0–1 | 0.3 | 0.1–0.5 | Pitch envelope depth — how much the transient sweeps down. Higher = more melodic drums. |
| `ofr_transientSat` | 0–1 | 0.15 | 0.1–0.4 | Transient saturation — analog warmth on the initial hit. |
| `ofr_cityMode` | 0–4 | 0 (NY) | — | 0=New York (tight, gated), 1=Detroit (saturated, drunk timing), 2=LA (compressed, wide), 3=Toronto (sub-ducked), 4=Bay Area (allpass fog) |
| `ofr_cityIntensity` | 0–1 | 0.5 | 0.3–0.8 | How strongly the city chain colors the sound. 0 = dry, 1 = full character. |
| `ofr_cityBlend` | 0–1 | 0.0 | 0.0–0.5 | Crossfade between current city and the next city in sequence. Creates hybrid geographic character. |
| `ofr_digCuriosity` | 0–1 | 0.5 | 0.3–0.7 | Berlyne hedonic curve: 0 = predictable hits, 0.5 = optimal novelty, 1.0 = alien mutations. |
| `ofr_digComplexity` | 0–1 | 0.5 | 0.3–0.6 | Wundt curve: how many parameters are varied per trigger event. |
| `ofr_digFlow` | 0–1 | 0.5 | 0.4–0.7 | Csikszentmihalyi flow: probability of reusing previous variation (groove memory). |
| `ofr_dustVinyl` | 0–1 | 0.2 | 0.05–0.3 | Vinyl crackle layer (Poisson impulse process). |
| `ofr_dustTape` | 0–1 | 0.1 | 0.05–0.2 | Tape hiss and soft-clip compression. |
| `ofr_dustBits` | 4–16 | 16 | 8–12 | Bit depth reduction. 16 = pristine, 8 = SP-1200 character. |
| `ofr_flipLayers` | 1–4 | 1 | 1–3 | Number of stacked layers per hit. More layers = denser, collaged sound. |
| `ofr_flipChop` | 0–1 | 0.0 | 0.0–0.4 | Chop simulation — grain fracturing of the transient. |

### Per-Voice Parameters (×8 voices)
| Parameter | Range | Default | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `ofr_v{n}_type` | 0–7 | voice-mapped | Drum topology: 0=Kick, 1=Snare, 2=CHat, 3=OHat, 4=Clap, 5=Rim, 6=Tom, 7=Perc |
| `ofr_v{n}_tune` | -24–+24 st | 0 | Pitch offset in semitones |
| `ofr_v{n}_decay` | 0.001–2.0s | type-dependent | Envelope decay time (exp, skewed 0.5) |
| `ofr_v{n}_body` | 0–1 | type-dependent | Body/noise balance — tonal vs. noisy character |
| `ofr_v{n}_level` | 0–1 | 0.8 | Voice output level |
| `ofr_v{n}_pan` | -1–+1 | stereo-spread | Stereo position |

### Sound Design Tips
1. **Start with City = Detroit, DIG at 0.3.** The drunk timing gives immediate Dilla feel. Low curiosity keeps hits recognizable while micro-timing adds humanity.
2. **Layer sparingly.** `ofr_flipLayers` at 2 thickens without losing transient clarity. At 4, you're in abstract collage territory — use intentionally.
3. **Bit crush for SP-1200 character.** Set `ofr_dustBits` to 12 and `ofr_dustSampleRate` to 26040. This recreates the frequency response of the E-mu SP-1200's Swyft chip.
4. **Flow controls groove memory.** High `ofr_digFlow` (0.7+) means the engine remembers and reuses its previous variations — the drums develop a "vocabulary" over time. Low flow (0.2) means every hit is independently varied.
5. **Per-voice type swapping.** Assign `ofr_v0_type` to something unexpected (like putting a Perc topology on the kick slot). The topology defines the synthesis model, not the MIDI note — any model can live on any pad.
6. **City blending for hybrid character.** Set `ofr_cityBlend` to 0.3–0.5 with NY mode. The blend crossfades toward Detroit, creating a NY-Detroit hybrid that's tighter than pure Detroit but warmer than pure NY.

### Coupling
- **Sends:** `AmpToFilter` (drum amplitude as filter mod source), `AmpToChoke` (note-off choke signal), `RhythmToBlend` (trigger rhythm pattern), `EnvToDecay` (envelope shape), `AudioToFM` (audio signal for FM)
- **Receives:** `RhythmToBlend` (external rhythm drives collage intensity — OSTINATO world rhythms controlling FLIP), `AmpToFilter` (sidechain from another engine)
- **Best as source for:** `RhythmToBlend` (boom bap groove driving tonal engines), `AudioToFM` (drum transients as FM source)

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OSTINATO:** World drum patterns (RhythmToBlend) driving OFFERING's collage engine. Cultural dialogue between OSTINATO's 96 world patterns and OFFERING's boom bap topology.
- **+ OBESE:** Fat analog bass under OFFERING drums. OBESE's Mojo character complements the crate aesthetic. Use `AmpToFilter` so kick hits duck the bass filter.
- **+ OXBOW:** OFFERING drums feeding OXBOW's entangled reverb. Boom bap hits dissolving into quantum suspension — the crate becomes infinite.
- **+ OVERBITE:** Layer OVERBITE's fang-white transients over OFFERING's textured drums. Two percussion engines with completely different characters: OVERBITE for sharp metallic hits, OFFERING for warm dusty drums.
- **+ OPTIC:** OFFERING's drum triggers driving OPTIC's visual engine. Every hit creates a visual pulse — the crate digging process becomes visible.

## 47. OUTLOOK (XOutlook)
*Panoramic visionary synth — the Albatross*

**Accent:** Horizon Indigo `#4169E1` | **Prefix:** `look_` | **Voices:** 8
**Creature:** The Albatross — Surface Soarer
**Polarity:** 25% feliX / 75% Oscar — atmospheric, wide, expressive
**Depth:** Surface (open sky)

### What It Does
OUTLOOK is a pad/lead synthesizer that sees across the horizon. It combines panoramic wavetable scanning with a parallax stereo field that shifts perspective as you play — low notes produce narrow, grounded images while high notes spread wide with micro-detuned parallax layers.

Four interlocking systems:
1. **PANORAMA OSCILLATOR:** Dual wavetable with horizon scanning — a single control sweeps both tables in opposite directions, creating evolving interference patterns. 8 wave shapes per table (Sine, Triangle, Saw, Square, Pulse, Super, Noise, Formant).
2. **PARALLAX STEREO FIELD:** Note pitch controls stereo depth. Low notes narrow, high notes spread wide. Creates natural depth perspective without reverb.
3. **VISTA FILTER:** Dual SVF (LP + HP in series) with a "horizon line" parameter — sweeping it opens or closes the spectral vista. Velocity-scaled for D001 compliance.
4. **AURORA MOD:** Two LFOs feed a luminosity modulator. When both LFOs align (conjunction), brightness peaks. When opposed, the sound darkens. Organic breathing that follows celestial logic.

### Macros
| Macro | Name | Mapping | What It Controls |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| M1 | **CHARACTER** | `look_macroCharacter` → horizon scan position | How far across the horizon — familiar center vs. extreme scanning |
| M2 | **MOVEMENT** | `look_macroMovement` → LFO depth modulation | Aurora breathing intensity — still vs. living |
| M3 | **COUPLING** | `look_macroCoupling` → internal coupling depth | Cross-oscillator interaction strength |
| M4 | **SPACE** | `look_macroSpace` → reverb/delay mix | Spatial depth — intimate vs. cathedral |

### Key Parameters
| Parameter | Range | Default | Sweet Spot | What It Does |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `look_horizonScan` | 0–1 | 0.5 | 0.3–0.7 | Panoramic scan position — sweeps both oscillators in opposite directions. Center = balanced, extremes = interference. |
| `look_parallaxAmount` | 0–1 | 0.5 | 0.4–0.8 | How much pitch affects stereo width. Low = mono, high = extreme parallax depth. |
| `look_vistaLine` | 0–1 | 0.7 | 0.3–0.9 | Filter horizon aperture. Low = dark/closed, high = bright/open vista. |
| `look_resonance` | 0–1 | 0.3 | 0.2–0.5 | Vista filter resonance. Higher values add harmonic ringing at the horizon line. |
| `look_filterEnvAmt` | 0–1 | 0.5 | 0.3–0.7 | How much the filter envelope opens the vista on each note. Velocity-scaled (D001). |
| `look_waveShape1` | 0–7 | Sine | — | Oscillator 1 wave: Sine, Triangle, Saw, Square, Pulse, Super, Noise, Formant |
| `look_waveShape2` | 0–7 | Saw | — | Oscillator 2 wave (scans in opposite direction to Osc 1) |
| `look_oscMix` | 0–1 | 0.5 | 0.3–0.7 | Blend between the two panoramic oscillators |
| `look_lfo1Rate` | 0.01–20 | 0.5 | 0.02–2.0 | Aurora LFO 1 rate. Below 0.1 Hz for deep breathing (D005). |
| `look_lfo1Depth` | 0–1 | 0.3 | 0.1–0.5 | Aurora LFO 1 → filter cutoff modulation depth |
| `look_lfo2Rate` | 0.01–20 | 0.3 | 0.01–1.0 | Aurora LFO 2 rate. Conjunction with LFO1 creates luminosity peaks. |
| `look_lfo2Depth` | 0–1 | 0.2 | 0.1–0.4 | Aurora LFO 2 → amplitude luminosity modulation |

### Coupling Interface
- **Sends:** Post-filter stereo output via `getSampleForCoupling()` — smooth pad/lead signal
- **Receives:** `AmpToFilter` (amplitude → vista filter cutoff), `LFOToPitch` (LFO → parallax depth), `EnvToMorph` (envelope → horizon scan position)
- **Best as source for:** `AmpToFilter` (smooth pad swells modulating other engines' filters), `EnvToMorph` (gradual horizon shifts as morph source)

### Recommended Pairings
- **+ OPENSKY:** Shimmer stacking — OUTLOOK's parallax width combined with OPENSKY's Shepard shimmer reverb. Use `AmpToFilter` to let OUTLOOK swells open OPENSKY's brightness.
- **+ OMBRE:** Memory/vision dialogue — OUTLOOK's panoramic present combined with OMBRE's dual-narrative memory/forgetting engine. `EnvToMorph` to link vista position to OMBRE's blend axis.
- **+ OPAL:** Granular parallax — OPAL's grain clouds diffusing OUTLOOK's panoramic oscillators. `AudioToFM` for metallic grain interference.
- **+ OXBOW:** Entangled reverb tail — OUTLOOK pads feeding OXBOW's chiasmus FDN. The panoramic vista dissolving into golden standing waves.
